                collection includes information about her work with the National Council of Jewish
                Women in the 1920's, and with the National Refugee Service (and predecessor
                organizations) in the 1930's. Information is included about her work as a
                Resettlement Supervisor in the post-World War II Displaced Persons camps in Europe,
                and as a field worker in the southwestern U.S. for the United Service for New

                in 1937 and 1946; as a representative for United HIAS Service to aid in settling
                Egyptian and Hungarian refugees in 1957-1958; and as a pleasure trip and evaluation
                of the changes in the Jewish community of the country in 1963. Also included in the

            <p>Cecilia Razovsky was an immigration and refugee relief worker whose extraordinary
                career spanned the early <date>1900s</date> to the <date>1960s</date>. Her life's
                work began with assisting <emph render="bold">Eastern European immigrants</emph> in
                the early <date>1900's</date>, continued with helping <emph render="bold">German
                    refugees</emph> during World War II, working overseas in <emph render="bold"
                    >Displaced Persons Camps</emph>, aiding refugees in <emph render="bold">United
                    States Detention Camps</emph> after the War, encouraging <emph render="bold"
                    >Jewish communities in Southwest United States</emph> to take refugee families,
                and culminated with organizing resettlement efforts in <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">South America</emph>
                </geogname>, <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Central America</emph>
                </geogname>, and the <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">West Indies</emph>
                </geogname>. She worked for major refugee relief organizations: <corpname>
                    <emph render="bold">National Council of Jewish Women</emph>
                </corpname>, <corpname>

                    <emph render="bold">Citizen's Committee on Displaced Persons</emph>
                </corpname>. Against resistant administrations, she tirelessly negotiated for
                admissions of <emph render="bold">German children</emph> into the United States,
                landing rights for the <emph render="bold">
                    <emph render="italic">SS. St. Louis</emph>
                </emph> in <geogname>Cuba</geogname> and the <emph render="bold">
                    <emph render="italic">SS Quanza</emph>
                </emph> in <geogname>Mexico</geogname> and the <geogname>United States</geogname>,
                and increasing immigration opportunities in the <geogname>Americas</geogname> and
                    <geogname>West Indies</geogname>.</p>

            <p>Born <date>May 4, 1886</date> to immigrant parents Minna and Jonas Razovsky in
                    <geogname>St. Louis, MO</geogname>, Razovsky sewed buttons on overalls in a
                factory at age <num>12</num> to contribute to her family's income. She held a
                variety of jobs after school, working as a salesgirl, waitress, laundress,
                stenographer, clerk, and secretary until she took up teaching for the <corpname>
                    <emph render="bold"> Jewish Educational Alliance</emph>
                </corpname> in <emph render="bold">St. Louis</emph> at age <num>18</num>. There, she
                gave evening lessons in English and History to immigrants and taught Biblical
                literature and Hebrew to children on Saturdays and Sundays. In <date>1911</date>,
                she became an Attendance Officer for the <corpname>
                    <emph render="bold">St. Louis Board of Education</emph>
                </corpname>, interviewing applicants and issuing employment certificates to children
                who qualified under the new <emph render="bold">Child Labor Law</emph>. She oversaw
                the probation of delinquent girls and studied the street trade situation in
                    <geogname>St. Louis</geogname> in <date>1912</date>. This position led her in
                    <date>1917</date> to become an Inspector for the <corpname>
                    <emph render="bold">Child Labor Division</emph>
                </corpname>, <corpname>
                    <emph render="bold">Children's Bureau</emph>
                </corpname>, in <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Washington, D.C.</emph>
                </geogname> She inspected mills and factories in <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Alabama</emph>
                </geogname>, <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Eastern Ohio</emph>
                </geogname>, and <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Virginia</emph>
                </geogname> for compliance to the <emph render="bold">Child Labor Law</emph>. She
                examined the physical and educational development of Southern children, studied the
                effect of the First World War on child labor and school attendance throughout the
                    <geogname>United States</geogname>, and surveyed the administration of the <emph

                    <emph render="bold">District of Columbia</emph>
                </geogname>. Concurrently, she attended classes in social work, drama, literature,
                economics, law, psychology, labor problems, public relations, and Spanish in a
                variety of schools in <geogname>St. Louis</geogname>, <geogname>Chicago</geogname>,

            </p>
            <p>Razovsky returned to her earlier inclination towards helping immigrants and in
                    <date>1921</date> became Executive Secretary for the <corpname>
                    <emph render="bold">National Council of Jewish Women's (NCJW) Department of
                        Immigrant Aid</emph>
                </corpname>. As she writes, "I was always interested in the literature about
                immigrants, living among them in my youth, and the stories in English written about
                them were to me fascinating and all the authors, like <persname>Anzia Yierska
                    [Yezierska] Kahn</persname>, were my heroes and heroines..."<ref

                </ref></p>
            <p>Her unusual abilities were noticed and a year later she was appointed Associate
                Director. She also served as Editor of the <corpname>NCJW</corpname> bulletin, <emph
                    render="bold">
                    <emph render="italic">The Immigrant</emph>
                </emph>, for ten years.</p>

            <p>In <date>1921</date>, <persname>
                    <emph render="bold">President Harding</emph>
                </persname> signed the <emph render="bold">"Three Per Cent Immigration Law"</emph>
                and in <date>1924</date> a permanent <emph render="bold">Immigration Restriction
                    Bill</emph> was put into effect. <corpname>NCJW</corpname> worked on
                legislation, oriented immigrants to their new life in the <geogname>United
                States</geogname>, and established a <corpname>
                    <emph render="bold">Bureau of International Case Work</emph>
                </corpname> to help reunite immigrants with their families overseas. Razovsky
                traveled throughout the <geogname>United States</geogname> training local
                    <corpname>NCJW</corpname> committees on how to organize English and Citizenship
                classes. She met immigrants arriving at <geogname>Ellis Island</geogname> and other
                ports and developed international services to relatives abroad through agencies in
                    <geogname>Europe</geogname>, <geogname>Asia</geogname>, and <geogname>South
                    America</geogname>. She lectured for students and professional groups,
                conducting <corpname>
                    <emph render="bold">Institutes on Education of the Foreign Born</emph>
                </corpname>. In <date>1922</date>, Razovsky authored her first book; <emph
                    render="bold">
                    <emph render="italic">What Every Emigrant Should Know</emph>
                </emph>. She wrote <emph render="bold">
                    <emph render="italic">What Every Woman Should Know About Citizenship</emph>
                </emph> in <date>1926</date>. This book addressed the <emph render="bold">Cable Act
                    of 1922</emph>, which required women to apply individually for citizenship
                versus making them automatic citizens under their husband's name. Although feminists
                saw the Act as a victory, it increased the hardship of many immigrant women, who
                were in greater danger of being deported; deserted overseas; and denied pensions,
                medical care, and employment. In <date>1938</date>, Razovsky updated <emph

                    <emph render="italic">What Every Woman Should Know About Citizenship</emph>

                    <emph render="italic">Making Americans</emph>
                </emph>. This booklet, directed at the volunteer community, gave instructions on how
                to set up naturalization committees and bureaus, and provided information on
                immigration law and procedures.<ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="FTN4">

            <p>Razovsky was sent as a <corpname>NCJW</corpname> delegate to the <emph render="bold"
                    >First World Congress of Jewish Women</emph> in <geogname>Austria</geogname> in
                    <date>1923</date> and addressed the conference on immigration. After the
                conference, she toured European ports and evaluated conditions for refugees. Many
                refugees prevented from entering the <geogname>United States</geogname> were
                admitted into <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Cuba</emph>
                </geogname> and Razovsky was sent there in <date>1924</date> to assist and evaluate
                the poor conditions for emigrant Jews. Razovsky served, from <date>1925-1935</date>,
                as Secretary of the <corpname>
                    <emph render="bold">Jewish Committee for Cuba</emph>
                </corpname>. In <date>1931</date>, Razovsky visited <geogname>Russia</geogname> in
                order to study social service conditions.</p>

            <p>During this time, she was highly involved in legislation and policy making, attending
                major conferences and committees on immigration and particularly on the <emph
                    render="bold">German refugee</emph> crisis during the <date>1930s</date>. She
                served in various capacities for the <corpname>

                <date>1928</date>. In <date>1929</date>, Razovsky represented several American

                </geogname>, perhaps for a vacation or a medical conference, and were once again
                called upon by <persname>
                    <emph render="bold">Israel Jacobson</emph>

                </corpname> business. Razovsky investigated the condition of the <corpname>
                    <emph render="bold">HIAS</emph>
                </corpname> Representative in <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Mexico City</emph>
                </geogname> who was rumored to have suicidal tendencies (she found him capable of
                performing his duties) and gathered information for <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Mexico's</emph>
                </geogname> country profile. She also attended a meeting of voluntary <emph

            <p>Razovsky found that many leaders of the Jewish <emph render="bold">Mexican</emph>
                community had "an obvious indifference to <corpname>UHS [HIAS]</corpname> and its
                work in <geogname>Mexico</geogname>. People who are interested in helping relatives
                join them go to one or two special attorneys who help them and who charge high
                fees..." From January through <date>May 1959</date>, an estimated fifty-six Jewish
                immigrants had been admitted into the country despite the fact that the political
                party in control for the past twenty-five years, the <emph render="bold">Partido
                    Revolucionario Institutional</emph>, was "officially" opposed to immigration.
                Many of the Jewish immigrants came from <emph render="bold">Syria</emph> and about
                    <num>12</num> were <emph render="bold">Egyptian</emph>. <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Mexico</emph>
                </geogname>, poor and with a turbulent political history, had broken away from rigid
                    <emph render="bold">Church</emph> domination with the adoption of its
                <date>1917</date> Constitution, and was in the midst of rapid industrialization. The
                members of the Jewish community (Razovsky's estimate ranged from <num>25,000</num>
                to <num>35,000</num>) were given equal status and were mainly involved in light
                industry. <num>90</num>% of the Jewish population lived in <geogname>

                </geogname> to attend a medical conference. Razovsky wrote to <persname>Israel

            <p>From <date>June 9</date> until <date>November 19, 1963</date>, the
                <famname>Davidsons</famname> lived in <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Brazil</emph>
                </geogname>. For the first two weeks, the couple stayed with their dear friends <persname>
                    <emph render="bold">Ludwig</emph>
                </persname> and <persname>

                </persname> in <geogname>S&#227;o Paulo</geogname>, whom they had first met in
                    <date>1937</date> when Razovsky evaluated conditions for <emph render="bold"
                    >German refugees</emph> in <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Brazil</emph>
                </geogname> for the <corpname>
                    <emph render="bold">NCC</emph>
                </corpname>. Razovsky first stop was the <corpname>
                    <emph render="bold">HIAS</emph>
                </corpname> office, where she was welcomed by several of her former colleagues. She
                also met with her good friend <persname>
                    <emph render="bold">Susanna Franks</emph>
                </persname> who asked Razovsky to conduct a volunteer training course for the <corpname>
                    <emph render="bold">Liga Feminina (Brazil's NCJW)</emph>
                </corpname>. The couple then spent two weeks in <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Rio de Janeiro</emph>
                </geogname>, where they met with friends, and where Razovsky visited the <corpname>
                    <emph render="bold">CIME</emph>
                </corpname> office, attended lectures at the <emph render="bold">Academy of
                Letters</emph> and a seminar at the <emph render="bold">Catholic School of Social
                    Work</emph>, and visited another school of social work and the <emph
                    render="bold">Indian Embassy</emph>. Following, the couple spent nine days
                touring <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Bela Horizonte</emph>
                </geogname>, <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Ouro Preto</emph>
                </geogname>, <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Brasilia</emph>
                </geogname>, and <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Salvador da Bahia</emph>
                </geogname> before returning to <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Rio de Janeiro</emph>
                </geogname> on <date>July 23, 1963</date> for an additional three-week stay. There,
                Razovsky attended a Congress held by the <corpname>
                    <emph render="bold">International Association of Family Welfare</emph>
                </corpname> with her friends <persname>
                    <emph render="bold">Susanna Frank</emph>
                </persname> and <persname>
                    <emph render="bold">Flora Levine</emph>
                </persname>. On <date>August 13, 1963</date>, the couple returned to <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">S&#227;o Paulo</emph>
                </geogname> for a month's stay. Razovsky visited several welfare agencies, among
                which was the <corpname>
                    <emph render="bold">Confederaci&#243;n Evangelista</emph>
                </corpname>, which managed immigration port reception and integration. Apparently
                there was little immigration into <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Brazil</emph>
                </geogname>, and the social worker she spoke with was working on a <emph
                    render="bold">colonization project</emph> to settle dispossessed <emph
                    render="bold">squatters</emph>. The <famname>Davidsons</famname> toured the <corpname>
                    <emph render="bold">Albert Einstein Hospital</emph>
                </corpname>, still in its construction phase, which was "to be a showplace to show
                Brasilians Jews are grateful for having been given refuge in
                <geogname>Brasil</geogname>." She attended seminars at the <emph render="bold"
                    >School for Social Work</emph>, and visited the <corpname>
                    <emph render="bold">Conselho de Assistencia Social</emph>
                </corpname> that she had been in charge of in <date>1957</date>. The couple spent
                five weeks in <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Campos do Jord&#227;o</emph>
                </geogname>, where they heard news of strikes and a threat of martial law occurring
                in <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">S&#227;o Paulo</emph>
                </geogname>. They left <emph render="bold">Campos do Jord&#227;o</emph> for
                    <emph render="bold">S&#227;o Paulo</emph>, relieved that no martial law was
                instituted, but were welcomed with a taxi strike. Razovsky writes; "As MD [Dr.
                Morris Davidson] put it <geogname>Brasil</geogname> is having a cold civil
                war-strikes every day-middle class fighting government and labor." On <date>October
                    30, 1963</date>, they were forced back to their hotel upon seeing
                <num>10,000</num> strikers marching. They returned to <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">El Paso, Texas</emph>
                </geogname> on <date>November 22, 1963</date>, the day <persname>
                    <emph render="bold">John F. Kennedy</emph>
                </persname> was assassinated. She writes, "Shall we ever know the whole truth?
                Except that the organizations preaching hate are to blame!!"<ref actuate="onrequest"

            <p>The <famname>Davidsons'</famname> return to the <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">United States</emph>
                </geogname> did not signal an end to their traveling. Choosing <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">San Diego, California</emph>
                </geogname> as a retirement site, the <famname>Davidsons</famname> moved into a
                studio apartment close to <emph render="bold">San Diego State College</emph> on
                    <date>November 30, 1963</date>. During this time, Razovsky wrote her manuscript,
                "Forty Thousand New Brazilians," which tracked the Jewish community's progress in <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Brazil</emph>
                </geogname> through Razovsky's visits there that occurred in <date>1937</date>,
                    <date>1946-1947</date>, <date>1954</date>, <date>1957-1958</date>, and
                    <date>1963</date>.</p>

            <p>She sent the manuscript to several colleagues, asking for editorial comments and
                suggestions for possible publishing venues, however, it does not seem that she sent
                the manuscript out to publishers. In <date>June 1964</date> the
                <famname>Davidsons</famname> attended two welfare conferences in <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Los Angeles</emph>
                </geogname>; they then visited <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">San Francisco</emph>
                </geogname> and lived for a month in <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Berkeley</emph>
                </geogname>. Razovsky writes, "We are now trying to decide where to go when we leave
                Berkeley around the <num>26</num><emph render="super"

                    <geogname>Montreal</geogname>? <geogname>Brazil</geogname>?" They chose to visit
                Razovsky's brother <persname>Robert</persname> in <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Dallas</emph>
                </geogname> in <date>September 1964</date>, then flew to <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">El Paso</emph>
                </geogname> for a week and returned to <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">San Diego</emph>
                </geogname> on <date>October 22, 1964</date>. They were "too sick and weary" to
                attend the funeral of <persname>Maury</persname>, Razovsky's brother, who died on
                    <date>October 25, 1964</date> in <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">St. Louis, Missouri</emph>
                </geogname>. The couple moved out of their studio into a more luxurious apartment in <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">San Diego</emph>
                </geogname> in <date>December 1964</date>.<ref actuate="onrequest" show="new"

            <p>Both Razovsky and Dr. Davidson began to suffer from health problems. In <date>April
                    1965</date>, Razovsky had <emph render="bold">surgery</emph>, perhaps for
                ovarian cancer, in <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">Los Angeles</emph>
                </geogname>. Dr. Davidson suffered from two <emph render="bold">hemorrhages</emph>
                in one of his eyes. Razovsky writes, "I wish we were in <geogname>Dallas</geogname>
                so family can comfort us..." By <date>January 1966</date>, Dr. Davidson could no
                longer use his right eye and Razovsky needed to read for him.<ref

            <p>Razovsky still kept active in immigration affairs. In <date>1967</date>, she was
                serving as Chairman of the <corpname>
                    <emph render="bold">International Committee for Social Work</emph>
                </corpname>, which was formed under the <emph render="bold">San Diego branch</emph>
                of the <corpname>
                    <emph render="bold">National Association of Social Work</emph>
                </corpname>. In what seems to be her last documented project, Razovsky was trying to
                construct an agency in <geogname>
                    <emph render="bold">San Diego</emph>
                </geogname> to handle problems of <emph render="bold">Mexican-Americans</emph> and

            <p>After a lifetime of service in social work and immigration relief, Razovsky succumbed
                to a long illness, and at the age of <num>81</num>, she passed away on
                    <date>September 27, 1968</date>. She was survived by her husband, two brothers (<persname>

            <p> Cecilia's death is a loss to all of us, not because of her Jewishness, which was
                positive; not because of any extraordinary behavioral science knowledge or social
                work skill, but because of her heart and her concern for people, which unfortunately
                are all too hard to find among our professional colleagues... She was one of the
                last of a fast disappearing breed-namely those who are sincere in their concern for
                others-not just those in their clinic but those who are 'out there' and need to be
                helped, and even those who don't know that they can be helped..."<ref

            <p>Scope and Content Note</p>
            <p>The papers of Cecelia Razovsky (married name: Davidson) documents the immigration
                worker's involvement in immigration and refugee relief from the early
                <date>1900's</date> to the <date>1960's</date>. The collection also contains
                material from her personal life and published works. Among the organizations
                Razovsky worked for include the National Council of Jewish Women, National Refugee
                Service, German Jewish Children's Aid, American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee,
                United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency, United Service for New Americans,
                Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society Service, and Citizen's Committee on Displaced Persons.</p>
            <p>Significant correspondents include Jane Addams, Louis Brandeis, Carrie Chapman Catt,
                Joseph P. Chamberlain, Philip Cowen, Alberto Gonzales Fernandez, Israel Jacobson,
                Max Kohler, Herbert H. Lehman, Rosa Manus, James G. McDonald, Henry Morgenthau Jr.,
                Frances Perkins, James Rice, Joseph S. Shubow, Edward M. Warburg, and Stephen S.
                Wise.</p>
            <p>The papers are valuable to researchers studying the following aspects of Jewish
                immigration in the United States: Eastern European influx in the early
                <date>1900's</date>, German refugees during World War II, U.S. detention camps and
                resettlement of World War II refugees, and local resettlement efforts for World War
                II refugees in the Southwest. The collection also pertains to the study of relief
                work conducted in displaced persons camps in France and Germany; and evaluations of
                countries for resettlement, particularly in the West Indies, Central America, and
                South America. Of interest is material relating to Razovsky's efforts to organize

                                    information because he wants his relatives from Russia to settle
                                    in one of these countries (because it's so hard to get people
                                    into the U.S.). Canada is too restrictive, Cuba is entirely out
                                    of the question (immigrants are suffering from the heat, don't
                                    know the language, and are mostly unemployed), Mexico has very
                                    few Jews, and it's hard to find them jobs because the country is
                                    so agricultural, Argentina is almost entirely closed to
                                    immigration, Uruguay and Brazil are almost impossible to find
                                    jobs in. "I want to emphasize the fact that no matter to what
                                    country such prospective emigrants will proceed, they will have
                                    to suffer and work very hard. The peace and comfort they are
                                    seeking will only be found after years of struggle and
                                effort."</p>

                                    indifferent and neglectful towards their families. The
                                    Department of Immigrant Aid of the National Council of Jewish
                                    Women has received many requests from agencies abroad to locate
                                    such husbands and induce them to send maintenance to their
                                    families until they may be reunited in this country. These cases
                                    are classified in the files of the office of the Department of
                                    Immigrant Aid as 'I-19' Domestic Relations cases."</p>

                        Report on German Jewish Situation," dated <date>October 9, 1933</date>, that
                        describes <emph render="bold">NCJW's</emph> role in assisting <emph

                        collaboration with Jewish and non-Jewish agencies. The report mentions the
                        formation of a <emph render="bold">Joint Clearing Bureau</emph>. In
                            <date>January 1934</date> Razovsky recommended an outline for an <emph

                            render="bold">NCJW</emph> with a plea to "begin to work at once" and
                        "the life and faith of human beings are at stake" in a cover letter dated
                            <date>April 26, 1935</date>. Enclosed is a report from the <emph

                        German-Jewish Children." Mentioned within the report is the transplanting of
                        families, scholarships for retraining, homes for children, and a milk fund
                        for <emph render="bold">Paris refugee children</emph>. Razovsky reports on
                            <emph render="bold">NCJW</emph> services to the Board of Directors in
                            <date>November 20-22, 1935</date>, specifically in the areas of dock

                        includes short histories of nineteen urgent scholarship cases.</p>
                    <p>The issue of deportation is further touched upon with a letter duplicated to
                        Razovsky from <emph render="bold">D.W. MacCormack, U.S. Commissioner of
                            Immigration and Naturalization</emph>. Dated <date>May 19, 1936</date>,
                        the letter is a response to <emph render="bold">Heywood Broun</emph> from
                        the <emph render="bold">
                            <emph render="italic">New York Telegram's</emph>

                            <emph render="bold">MacCormack</emph> defends deportation regulation
                        citing "the law in so far as it deals with aliens of good character was
                        absolutely inflexible." <emph render="bold">MacCormack</emph> further
                        addressed the <emph render="bold">National Conference on Social Work</emph>
                        in <date>May 26, 1936</date>, contemplating "What Would Happen If All Aliens
                        Were Deported?" An untitled, unauthored report dated <date>December 14,
                        1936</date> delineates the issue of hardship cases and deportations and the
                        need for discretion.</p>
                    <p>Razovsky and <emph render="bold">NCJW</emph> worked to stimulate public
                        interest in the <emph render="bold">German refugee</emph> situation.
                        Razovsky gave an <emph render="bold">NBC radio broadcast</emph> on
                            <date>July 9, 1934</date> titled "The United States and the German
                        Refugees." <emph render="bold">NCJW</emph> issued a press release "Saar
                        Plebiscite to Increase Number of Refugees, Aid Committee Head Says," on
                            <date>November 27, 1934</date>. An announcement of Razovsky's address at
                        a meeting of the <emph render="bold">Jewish Forum Association</emph>, titled
                        "The Migration of Jews From Germany" appeared in <date>October 1937</date>.</p>
                    <p>Praise for Razovsky is apparent in correspondence from various sources. MJK
                        (possibly <emph render="bold">Max J. Kohler</emph>) describes Razovsky and
                        the <emph render="bold">NCJW</emph> as "a very important factor" in German
                        Jewish immigrant relief and details Razovsky's committee appointments in a
                        letter written to <emph render="bold">Eugene S. Benjamin</emph> of the <emph
                            render="bold">Baron de Hirsch Fund</emph>, dated <date>December 12,
                        1933</date>. <emph render="bold">Frances Perkins, Secretary of Labor</emph>,
                        writes on behalf of <emph render="bold">Col. Daniel MacCormack</emph>,
                        thanking Razovsky for her work in the <emph render="bold">Ellis Island
                            Committee</emph>, dated <date>July 24, 1934</date>. The most telling
                        appreciation for Razovsky is evident in a letter from <emph render="bold"
                            >Blanche Goldman</emph>, Chair of the Executive Committee of NCJW on
                            <date>October 23, 1936</date>. <emph render="bold">Ms. Goldman</emph>
                        writes, "as you recall, you were loaned to the <emph render="bold">National

                                on selection of refugees from other countries. England: "there are a

                                attractive, strong, healthy, active." And various other countries

                            <p> Why does the country want these settlers? Because the dictator,
                                Trujillo, wants a white country, and interestingly, Jews are seen
                                here as white - "Ironically, the bitter race prejudice in the little
                                Caribbean republic crates a haven for victims of a different race
                                prejudice in the Reich. Jews are white, they are Europeans; they
                                will bring energy and higher standards of life and better ways of
                                doing things. They will mingle, eventually, with the population,
                                increasing the precious proportion of white blood." Also they'll
                                bring money. It'll give them political clout, as the country that
                                took refugees. Gains him lobbyists in America.</p>

                            <p> Rabbi Bernstein is taking a leave of absence from his congregation
                                Temple B'rith Kodesh, Rochester, New York to assist displaced
                                persons. There are currently two hundred thousand displaced persons,
                                "infiltrees from Eastern Europe." He expresses appreciation to the
                                Jewish agencies and United States government officials involved in
                                helping refugees. He examines the relationship between the military
                                and displaced persons. He writes of survivors of the Kielce pogrom
                                in Poland who are in a hospital in Lodz. Knowing a large amount of
                                refugees will be fleeing Poland, Bernstein describes the
                                difficulties in obtaining European government help. "My heart is
                                heavy as I report that not a single government in Europe has been
                                prepared to offer more that temporary shelter to these people." He
                                continues by addressing approaching problems, includes statistics of
                                displaced persons in allied zones (total is <num>218,201</num>), and
                                states "Palestine is the major hope... I can assure you that they
                                will brave every hardship and every danger to settle in

                            <p>A summary of Razovsky and the author's visit to Rio Brazil, where
                                only one meeting had been scheduled. Razovsky spent much of her time
                                trying to organize women committees. There are discrepancies between
                                various groups within the Rio Jewish community, however; all
                                contribute generously when solicited for funds. In general, not
                                enough "careful preparation" had been done to allow workers to help
                                in the funding campaign. Typewritten on the back of Morris
                                Davidson's stationery.</p>

                                    <num>91,000</num> in July and will be <num>140,000</num> more by
                                the end of the year. She asks Razovsky to stress the need for DPs
                                immigration to South America, and requests information on the Jewish
                                communities in South American countries. A handwritten message dated

                                    Secretary, from which a misunderstanding arose. The CIME
                                    Secretary was not expecting any refugees to arrive in the
                                    present time, and a misunderstanding (later straightened out)
                                    occurred with a cable that seemed to suggest CIME was limiting
                                    the refugee immigration. (See <ref actuate="onrequest"

                                    be included in this amount. (See <ref actuate="onrequest"

                                    time to carry out [day to day work]." She does not recommend

                                    Program. The minutes are not in the folder. She writes that
                                    after a great deal of pressure, the Mexican government agreed to
                                    grant visas to Mexican families stranded in Hong Kong, to allow
                                    them to be reunited with their Mexican relatives. Attached is a

                                    1959</date>. She is puzzled by the Representative health
                                    situation, describes a meeting she had with Mr. Maus from HIAS,
                                    and describes meeting she has had with agencies interested in
                                    forming the World Refugee Program. She will write the country's

                                    Jacobson to Razovsky, <date>July 23, 1959</date>. He is very
                                    concerned over the Representative's illness. He asks for
                                    statistics on arrivals, gives contacts of two women involved in
                                    forming the World Refugee Program, and asks for a profile on

                                    and unique. I am sorry that despite the fact that the Jews are
                                    prospering they appear to be self-centered and interested
                                    primarily in their own affairs..." He notes that Razovsky will

                    <p>Razovsky is pictured in three of the four photographs that comprise this
                        series. The fourth image is an informal wedding photograph of a couple in
                        Germany, <date>circa 1940s</date>. A passport photograph of Razovsky, most
                        likely in her 50s, provides a nice portrait. The two other photographs were
                        taken in her later years; in the first she accepts an award in Oklahoma and
                        in the other she is in the background in a hospital Christmas scene dated
