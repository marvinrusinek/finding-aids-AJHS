      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Origins of the National Jewish Welfare Board (1913-1919)</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Organized in 1917 to meet the needs of Jewish servicemen in the Armed Forces, the National Jewish Welfare Board (JWB) became a national federation of local agencies and social service institutions dedicated to meeting the social, cultural, intellectual, physical and spiritual needs of the American Jewish community.</p>
      <p>The roots of JWB can be traced to the founding of the Council of Young Men's Hebrew and Kindred Associations (YMHA-KA) in November 1913. This benevolent organization was established to promote and help coordinate the programs of the various Young Men's Hebrew Associations (YMHAs) and Jewish Community Centers (JCCs) throughout the United States. In 1916 the Council created a special Army
        and Navy Committee to attend to the religious and welfare needs of Jewish soldiers participating in military activities along the Mexican border. During World War I the Council decided to expand its services and aid rabbis serving near military posts. Unfortunately, the activities of the Council were hampered by its inability to speak for the entire American Jewish community. Furthermore,
        the absence of a unified coordinating agency led to a duplication of services and a scattering of limited resources.</p>
      <p>Hence, in April 1917, representatives of five major Jewish religious bodies (the United Synagogue, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, and the Agudath Ha-Rabbanim) joined with members of the Council to form the Jewish Board for Welfare Work in the United States Army and Navy. This new
        organization, however, was also deemed unsatisfactory since it relied primarily on the sponsorship of its member organizations. Therefore, in July 1917, the Jewish Board for Welfare Work was reorganized with control centralized in a small committee of three to five members. The close ties of the new Jewish Board to the Council of Young Men's Hebrew and Kindred Associations were severed and
        field secretaries were chosen to conduct new programs. In September 1917, the Commission on Training Camp Activities recognized the Board as the official agency for Jewish welfare work in military camps. In the summer of 1918, the name of the Board was changed to the Jewish Welfare Board, United States Army and Navy (shortened to Jewish Welfare Board in 1919) and the first by-laws and
        terms of office and membership were decided at a public meeting. JWB was now prepared to act as the representative agency for American Jewish servicemen in the United States military.</p>
      <p>The program activities of JWB during World War I included the enlistment of rabbis to serve as chaplains and the recruitment and training of lay workers. JWB created an abridged prayer book, reconciling the religious views of the Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform branches of Judaism, and distributed this to the soldiers. Prayer shawls, mezuzah scrolls, Jewish calendars, and many other
        items were also distributed. In addition, to meet the dietary needs of Jewish personnel, kosher food was provided in canteens and barracks. Non-religious activities sponsored by JWB included dances, literary clubs, classes in the English language and American history, and musical entertainment. Personal services included home visits to relatives of servicemen and a hospital visiting
        service to cheer the sick and wounded. In 1918, the programs and services of JWB were extended overseas, as workers were sent to Europe to assist Jewish Servicemen.</p>
      <p>By the war's end, JWB had developed a cadre of 638 field representatives, 178 of whom had served overseas. The new agency had an established staff made up of chaplains and lay workers, known as the "Star of David Men," who acted as personal councilors, teachers, spiritual leaders, and directors of religious services. Under the direction of JWB, the American Jewish community had mobilized
        to support the war effort and during this time, many organizations such as the B'nai B'rith, the National Council of Jewish Women, and the YMHA-KA became JWB affiliates. Thus, the Jewish Welfare Board had firmly established itself as one of the leading Jewish organizations in the United States.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Merger of JWB and the Council of YMHA-KA (1919-1921)</emph>
      </p>
      <p>The desire for a common meeting place for American Jews to promote their social, educational, and recreational development was widespread at the end of World War I. Consequently in the spring of 1920, at a special meeting of the JWB Executive Committee, it was determined that besides assisting military personnel, JWB would begin to support, advance, and serve the Jewish Community Center
        movement. It was further decided that JWB would merge with and assume the functions of the Council of YMHA-KA. By January 1921, a draft constitution was approved by the two organizations and in July 1921, the reorganized JWB was launched.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">The Inter-War Years (1921-1940)</emph>
      </p>
      <p>The mission of the newly reorganized JWB was threefold. First, the Board hoped to promote the social welfare of American Jewish servicemen by providing them with adequate opportunities for worship, education, devotion, solace and improvement. Second, the religious, intellectual, physical, and social well being of young Jewish men and women was to be supported. Finally, JWB dedicated
        itself to the development of JCCs, YMHAs, Young Women's Hebrew Associations (YWHAs), and other kindred societies.</p>
      <p>Membership in the new JWB consisted of local agencies such as JCCs, YM-YWHAs, regional federations of YMHAs and JCCs, and affiliated national organizations such as B'nai B'rith. As a result of this varied membership, JWB gained the authority to represent all American Jewish organizations.</p>
      <p>JWB was organized into two sections - Army and Navy services and Jewish Community Center services. Sixteen full time and part time JWB workers, community volunteers, and soldier representatives provided Army and Navy services. As the officially recognized Jewish religious and welfare agency for Jewish military personnel, these staffers covered 250 military establishments, Veterans
        hospitals, and naval stations.</p>
      <p>Services to JCCs were provided by a national office staff of three-a director and two assistants-and eight field secretaries. These field secretaries made hundreds of annual field visits and provided various consultation services to the JCCs in their sections. In addition, they prepared or supervised the development of Center publications and wrote community surveys and studies, which
        described and analyzed the local Jewish population, examined the condition of existing JCCs and summer camps, assessed the needs of Jewish students, studied general citywide problems and reviewed the needs for recreational and vocational activities. Finally, the authors drew conclusions and made recommendations that they hoped would improve the JCCs.</p>
      <p>The JCC's overall goal was to provide an element of unity, purpose and service to the Jewish community. To achieve this goal, JWB provided a multitude of services to the JCCs and supported and developed numerous programs during the 1930s that stressed the development of Jewish culture and the spirit of Judaism within the overall American context. These included youth programs, which were
        intended to emphasize the building of character. In addition, program activities focusing on Jewish holiday celebrations, Jewish history and problems, Jewish themes, and Jewish survival were developed. In 1922 JWB's Lecture and Concert Bureau assumed the direct management of selecting lecturers to participate in forums at local JCCs. Plays, pageants, bulletins, and brochures were developed
        and distributed to celebrate Jewish and civic holidays. Camping services were expanded in the 1930s and training for camp counselors was offered by JWB. JWB staff also organized educational conferences and conventions, prepared Jewish bibliographies and other publications, encouraged group insurance plans for Center workers, and devoted considerable resources to assisting JCCs in finding
        qualified staff. By these and other means, JWB attempted to develop balanced programs that would meet the cultural, social, intellectual, and physical needs of the Jewish community.</p>
      <p>Between 1937 and 1940 JWB staff grew, new regional federations were developed, and the field services division was expanded. Annual meetings were attended by hundreds of delegates and lay committees took an active part in promoting JWB programs. The National Health Advisory Board provided consultation and guidance in the improvement of health programs and standards at JCCs while the
        National Association of Jewish Center Workers provided JWB with an intimate knowledge of the Center worker field, and the National Finance Council provided a permanent base of financial support for JWB by helping it secure much-needed funds. By the end of 1940, JWB had developed close contact with both Jewish and non-Jewish social work agencies and continued to solidify its role as the
        Jewish body concerned with Jewish social work.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Dynamic Growth and World War II (1940-1946)</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In 1939, as the officially approved agency for Jewish religious and welfare work for Jewish military personnel, JWB began making preparations for a possible American involvement in the war in Europe. At the request of the United States Navy, JWB outlined the service personnel programs that they would be implementing in the event of war. In 1940 a national survey was conducted that
        reviewed service requirements, personnel needs, and local committee organization. By January 1941, JWB field men were working in the vicinity of training camps while Jewish chaplains were being commissioned into the armed forces in increasing numbers. Lastly, JWB's cooperative relationships with the YMCA, YWCA, National Travelers Aid Association, Salvation Army, and National Catholic
        Community Service, led to the establishment of the United Service Organization for National Defense, or USO, in 1941.</p>
      <p>When America became involved in World War II, JWB was ready to meet the needs of Jewish military personnel. At the beginning of the war fifteen national Jewish organizations were represented by JWB; by war's end that number had increased to thirty-eight.</p>
      <p>During the war, many new JWB committees and divisions were created to meet the wartime emergency. The Bureau of War Records was established to gather and preserve the war records of Jewish military personnel. Local war record committees were organized around the country to compile the war records of Jewish soldiers. As a result, a full account describing the activities of the Jewish
        soldier was published at the end of the war. In 1942, five national women's organizations affiliated with JWB began the Women's Organizations' Division. (The Division later expanded and become known as Women's Organizations' Services.) This division initiated projects to assist military personnel, organized and publicized work related to the war effort, and coordinated the efforts of women
        in local communities. In addition, the Committee on Personal Service was created to supervise and guide the work of field personnel servicing Jews in the military. By the end of the war, there were 626 Army and Navy Committees organized throughout the United States serving Jewish servicemen.</p>
      <p>JWB's war activities also reached around the globe. Chaplains could be found in the West Indies, India, Burma, China, North Africa, the Pacific Islands, Europe and the Middle East. They served on hospital and transport ships, on the ground with the infantry, and were among the first to reach the concentration camps and assist survivors. By the end of the war, a total of 311 JWB chaplains
        had served in the military.</p>
      <p>One of the main activities and tasks of JWB during the war was providing chaplains with the necessary supplies to meet the needs of Jewish soldiers. Enormous amounts of festival accessories, troop comforts, and kosher food were transported around the world and given to chaplains. Similarly, the recreational needs of soldiers were met by JWB at various USO buildings at home and abroad. In
        1943, JWB helped organize Jewish Hospitality Committees in Great Britain to aid Jewish servicemen. Religious hospitality centers, containing synagogues, social rooms, snack bars, and kosher kitchens, were set up by field representatives in Europe, Australia, India, and China. JWB also assisted in refugee work by providing religious services, parties, reading materials and textbooks for the
        displaced of Europe.</p>
      <p>The Women's Organizations' Division supplemented the work of the USO and the Jewish Chaplaincy. Through the efforts of Serve-a-Chaplain Committees the ladies helped gather supplies for chaplains. Members of the Serve-a-Hospital and Serve-a-Veterans Hospital Committees visited wounded veterans to help improve their morale. Included among the many items provided to Jewish servicemen by the
        women's division were games, books, records, toilet articles, holiday equipment, knitted goods, holiday material, and food parcels.</p>
      <p>The global war effort demanded a great exertion on the part of JWB to send supplies overseas. By 1946, JWB had distributed 900,000 packages of Matzoth, 30,000 gallons of wine, 50,000 cans of kosher meat, and 50,000 pounds of salami. Tons of fish, macaroons, and other holiday delicacies were provided to servicemen around the world. Moreover, 6 million books and pamphlets were produced and
        distributed by JWB. Two million holiday leaflets and 8.5 million holiday greeting cards were sent overseas. The circulation of religious accessories such as prayer books reached into the tens of thousands.</p>
      <p>With guidance provided by JWB, JCCs and YM-YWHAs also played an important role in the war effort. Many community center buildings became USOs and center workers provided servicemen with recreational programs, dances, parties, and hospitality. Center workers participated in Red Cross blood bank drives and the sale of war bonds. Furthermore, many JCCs began to provide nursery services and
        expanded educational opportunities for families with men in uniform.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">New Directions, Goals, and Organization in the Post-World War II Era (1948-1967)</emph>
      </p>
      <p>After World War II JWB began to redefine its programs and objectives to meet the needs of the Jewish community in post-World War II America and recast itself into a national social welfare agency helping to expand and develop the JCC movement. In 1947 JWB adopted a <emph render="italic">Statement of Principles on Jewish Community Center Purposes</emph> that became the credo of Center work
        and a condition of affiliation with JWB. This new credo made clear that Jewish content was fundamental to the JCC program and that the Centers were to become agencies for Jewish identification and integration. Center programs would encourage the development of Jewish culture, and provide educational and recreational opportunities for members. Furthermore, as a democratic institution, the
        Centers were to help advance democracy and the integration of the American Jew into American society.</p>
      <p>Over the next few years, JWB reorganized itself to meet its new responsibilities and as the Cold War began in 1948, JWB was ready to engage in a worldwide service to build and maintain the spiritual and morale life of Jewish GIs and dependents, and to assist Jewish chaplains and Jewish civilian communities.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">JWB services to Jewish Community Centers (1948-1967)</emph>
      </p>
      <p>JWB developed and provided a multitude of program services for JCCs during the 1950s and 1960s. It offered budgeting and building management advice, training services for center staff and executives, assistance in the purchasing of equipment and supplies, consultation in developing public relations programs, and aid in the establishment of health insurance coverage and retirement plans
        for center workers.</p>
      <p>Young people were an important part of the JCC, and JWB sponsored programs and activities designed to awaken their Jewish heritage. Additionally, JWB sponsored inter-city leadership training conferences, cultural workshops and seminars, study tours of Europe and Israel, exchange visits with families overseas, international Jewish youth assemblies and, in 1965, a national training
        institute for youth.</p>
      <p>During the 1960s both senior citizens and women became increasingly involved with the Center movement. To alleviate the isolation that came with old age, JWB encouraged special cultural, social, and recreational services to seniors. Women also turned to the JCCs for programming aid and leadership, and both regional and national leadership institutes were offered to Jewish women.</p>
      <p>JWB continued to provide a great number of services to JCCs. The camping service program was designed to strengthen Jewish identification and community as well as to provide an appreciation for Jewish life. Day and suburban camp participants included children, families, the elderly and the physically handicapped. The evaluation of camping sites, the development of camping programs, and
        the training and recruitment of staff were tasks that JWB performed for the Centers. The health and physical well being of JCC members also became a concern of JWB. Professional staff assisted center workers in the programming and planning of health activities. Additionally, JWB sponsored basketball, volleyball, golf, handball, and swimming tournaments around the country. It also helped to
        establish permanent athletic links between American Centers and Jewish youth organizations in Israel and other countries. By the mid-1960s, one million people were participating in the health and physical education programs sponsored by JWB and community centers.</p>
      <p>The promotion of Jewish culture also continued to be an integral part of the JWB program. Rich cultural programs were brought to hundreds of JCCs by the Lecture Bureau, exposing Center members to Jewish speakers, artists, thinkers, and exponents of the Jewish way of life. The Jewish Book Council supported and promoted an appreciation for Jewish literature in English, Hebrew, and Yiddish
        while the Jewish Music Council supported Jewish culture through music. Publications promoting Jewish culture were distributed by JWB to JCCs, synagogues, youth agencies, women's groups, and fraternal organizations.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">JWB services to GIs (1948-1967)</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In conjunction with the development of the JCC movement during the 1950s and 1960s, JWB continued offering services to American Jewish GIs. Chaplains provided religious literature and services, conducted educational programs, gave pastoral counseling to servicemen, and visited soldiers in hospitals around the world. They were assisted in these tasks by the newly created Military
        Sisterhoods, organized by Jewish servicemen's wives. These groups planned programs and obtained supplies for GI congregations. The USO also continued its leadership role and helped mobilize local Jewish community resources. Finally, the Women's Organizations' Services established a mail order service that sent items to chaplains and other volunteers serving Jewish servicemen abroad. Books,
        records, magazines, films, children's texts, classroom supplies, holiday decorations, and arts-and-crafts-materials were some of the items sent by the WOS to military posts around the world.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Jewish Links Abroad (1948-1967)</emph>
      </p>
      <p>One of the major goals of JWB after World War II was the establishment of the JCC movement abroad. During the 1950s, JWB program materials were translated into French, Spanish, Italian, Hebrew and Yiddish. Foreign youth councils were assisted and the introduction of Jewish Book and Music Councils overseas was begun. JWB also helped sponsor several international conferences hoping to
        strengthen the ties of Jews around the world. Among these were the Jewish Community Center World Fellowship Project (1955), the Conference of European and American Center Leaders (1964), the Standing Conference on European Jewish Community Services (1965) and the Commission on Centers and Camps (1965). In 1947 the World Federation of YMHAs and JCCs was created to aid in the revival of
        Jewish life around the world. (The Jerusalem Y became a major responsibility of the World Federation when it opened in 1950.) Finally, a dual exchange program was established with Israeli social workers that gave both Israeli and American Jews the opportunity to experience each other's Jewish cultures.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Change and Growth in the Post-World War II Era</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In the Post-World War II Era, JWB moved away from giving direct program services to the JCCs and instead, became more of a coordinating and consulting agency that provided resources, program materials, and technical guidance to JCCs to make Jewish values and traditions relevant to contemporary life in the United States.</p>
      <p>During the 1950s and 1960s JWB was successful in encouraging JCCs to become more family oriented to strengthen Jewish family life in a time of social and economic change. The Centers were recognized as serving important Jewish communal purposes, and became symbols and rallying points for Jewish living. With JWB guidance, JCCs helped to preserve, nourish, and give meaning in America to
        Jewish heritage and life.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Celebrations, Civil Rights and War (1967-1969)</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In 1967, JWB marked its 50<emph render="super">th</emph> anniversary by sponsoring new Jewish musical compositions and plays. The Jewish Book Council celebrated its 25<emph render="super">th</emph> anniversary by publishing a 448-page volume dedicated to American Jewish authors. Meanwhile, the Commission on Jewish Chaplaincy (originally founded in 1917 as the Chaplain's Committee)
        observed its silver jubilee by initiating new programs to provide religious and cultural materials and training to an expanding corps of lay leaders. Finally, the Women's Organizations Services re-dedicated itself on its 25<emph render="super">th</emph> anniversary by developing innovative programs to help assist military families.</p>
      <p>The building of new centers continued at a rapid pace. Between 1945 and 1969, 120 new JCCs were built. These new buildings reflected the changing needs and interests of the local Jewish community. Some of the more modern facilities included homes for the aged, day care centers, fixed seat theatres, practice music rooms, creative art rooms, jogging tracks, and therapy pools for the
        physically handicapped.</p>
      <p>To meet the demand for qualified staff to work in the expanding JCCs, JWB created the Bureau of Careers in Jewish Service to recruit Jewish civil servants and social workers. JWB offered national training services to the JCCs and provided open job listings of all professional vacancies, to encourage workers to stay in the social work field. Twenty-five different training projects were
        carried out by JWB's Training Services Department to orient new Center workers and to up-grade the skills of those already in the field. By 1969, the recruitment of Center workers had become a function of local Jewish communities with guidance provided by JWB's Personnel Services Department.</p>
      <p>Qualified rabbis were also in short supply during the 1960s. As opposition to the war in Vietnam increased, the Commission on Jewish Chaplaincy (CJC) intensified its recruitment efforts and continued to recruit lay leaders to carry on religious and educational programs for Jewish servicemen. To help alleviate the shortage of chaplains, in 1966, JWB developed a retention plan that
        encouraged rabbis to make the military chaplaincy a career. In 1969 the CJC began recruiting chaplains among rabbis holding civilian positions. JWB also helped organize regional conferences of Jewish chaplains, community leaders, JCC staff, and regional consultants to help develop a better understanding of the needs of servicemen.</p>
      <p>At the close of the 1960s JWB offered an energetic program that detected new social work needs, charted new directions, and pioneered new advances in social work practice. JWB's Service to Small Communities program began offering services to small and isolated Jewish communities throughout the country. It developed new programs to serve Jewish college youth and learn more about the
        attitudes, needs, and interests of the college generation. More intensive programming in Jewish music, drama, graphic arts, theatre, and dance were encouraged. And finally, displays of American Jewish history were developed and viewed by thousands in the Centers.</p>
      <p>Many of the programs and policies of JWB were shaped to a large degree by the increasing racial confrontation and social and political turmoil of the 1960s. Rising anti-Semitism in the black community led to an examination of how JCCs could contribute to an improvement in black-white relationships. As a result, the Centers began many social, recreational, and cultural programs in urban
        areas. These programs included tutorial and remedial reading classes, Center day and resident camps for the poor, head start programs, and child-care centers. Although most of these programs were offered to disadvantaged blacks, Puerto Ricans, Mexican-Americans, and impoverished Jews also participated. Center activities on behalf of the poor and disenfranchised reflected the belief of the
        majority of the Jewish community that Jews had a moral and economic interest in eliminating the causes of racial disorder and poverty.</p>
      <p>The development of links overseas continued to grow, particularly after the Six-Day War in 1967. The fate of Israel found a place in the hearts and minds of the Jewish people and the JCCs were infused with a new energy. They helped organize, direct, and motivate Jewish support for the state of Israel. JWB expertise was used to train staff in Israeli centers.</p>
      <p>Overseas links to Europe and other areas around the world were nurtured by JWB's international consultation program. JWB and Center professionals contributed to the planning and workshops of the International Conference of Jewish Communal Service in Jerusalem. Finally, JWB helped support outdoor Center demonstrations in support of Soviet Jewry.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">The JCCs respond to a changing Society</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Like most of America, the JWB and JCC movement was swept up in the societal changes of the 1970s and 1980s. The Jewish community faced a rise in alternative household arrangements that had little connection to the synagogue or JCC movement. Many Jews were single or divorced with children and a growing number were over the age of fifty. Moreover, the trend of intermarriage, assimilation,
        and lower births threatened the long-term survival of the Jewish community. As a result of these changes, JWB began to develop new cultural and educational programs to strengthen the Jewish community.</p>
      <p>Various counseling, single parent support groups, and recreational activities were started by JWB in response to the changing family environment. Programs were also developed for the homebound elderly, Jewish children unaffiliated with Jewish organizations, and older adults. Children, adults, and families were encouraged to explore their Jewish heritage and culture and to join synagogues
        and temples.</p>
      <p>As the 1980s progressed, fathering programs were designed to assist men as they took on additional parenting responsibilities at home. New day care programs for the elderly and horticultural therapy were offered to senior citizens. A Shalom Newcomers Network was begun to help Jewish families and individuals put down Jewish roots in new communities. By the end of the decade, the JCCs had
        developed a wide array of programs to deal with such everyday concerns as heart disease prevention, child abuse, and AIDS prevention.</p>
      <p>JWB reinforced its long-term commitment to Jewish education during the 1980s. To help the JCCs reach their full educational potential, in 1983 the Commission on Maximizing Jewish Education in Jewish Community Centers was given the task of studying Jewish educational programming. As a result of this study, new programs designed to stimulate Jewish awareness, knowledge, and identification
        were introduced into the JCCs. A wide range of educational activities for young and old, men and women, were established throughout the JCCs to enrich Jewish life and deepen their sense of Jewish identity and commitment.</p>
      <p>Foreign contacts continued and expanded with Jews in Venezuela, Canada, France, Israel, and in the Soviet Union. The JCCs celebrated the 30<emph render="super">th</emph> anniversary of Israeli's founding with special expos, walk-a-thons, music and dance programs, presentations, and athletic events. By 1979, there were ninety-one community centers in the Jewish State. JWB recognized the
        importance of its Israel connection when, in 1980, it helped sponsor the Israel Desk Program. This program was developed to encourage North American Jews to go to Israel to work, study, perform voluntary services, or perhaps to settle. It was aimed at making Israel more accessible to American Jewry.</p>
      <p>The influx of Russian Jews into the United States propelled the development of special JWB programs to ease the pains of readjustment. New programs in housing, healthcare, and legal rights were developed to help assimilate the new immigrants, and special classes in the reading and writing of English were also offered.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">New Directions and Programs</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In 1990 JWB, in order to more accurately reflect the organization's mission and goals, and its connection with the Jewish Community Center movement, changed its name to the Jewish Community Centers Association of North America (JCC Association). The JCC Association resolved to become more proactive in anticipating the needs of the Jewish community and in providing the mechanisms and
        resources to meet those needs.</p>
      <p>The 1990s witnessed the introduction of new programs and relationships overseas. A summer teen experience in Israel was launched, which emphasized education and leadership skills. In addition, executive training for Israeli staff was expanded and included graduate level courses focusing on Jewish issues within the context of Israel. An Israeli Fellowship Program and leadership training
        seminars were also offered. In 1999, the JCC Association began the Birthright Israel program, which sponsored first-time visits to Israel for American Jews. In the same year, the JCC Maccabi Xperience was started for high school and college students and for young professionals up to the age of 33. Maccabi programs included visits to cultural, historical, and geographical sites throughout
        Israel.</p>
      <p>The JCC Association also began to help rebuild Jewish communities in the former Soviet Union. Since most Russian Jews had little or no exposure to the Jewish religion, the JCC movement primarily concentrated on building connections to Jewish communities. JCC programs stressed the promotion of Jewish culture, education, and Jewish life. By 1997 thirty-eight JCCs were in operation in
        Russia.</p>
      <p>At home, the JCC Association continued the development of various programs to meet the needs of the Jewish community. Early childhood programs were promoted in the Centers, Young Judaea Clubs were started, and teen leadership summits, exploring such issues as respect, tolerance, and conflict resolution, were begun. The JCCs continued to stress the development of educational opportunities
        for its members. Programs to better educate and train lay leaders were started; scholarship and fellowship programs for teenagers were introduced; and an endowment was funded to bring world-class Jewish scholars to JCC conferences. Finally, continental standards to help measure JCC performances in meeting the goals of the movement were developed, covering everything from Jewish education
        programs to the safe storage of supplies.</p>
      <p>With the beginning of the new century, the JCC Association had gone high tech. It launched an online resource for Jewish early childhood educators and created an Internet service so that JCC professionals could interact with each other more efficiently. In addition, the JCC Association continued to develop innovative programming for the Jewish community. For instance, programs were
        established to educate and train JCC staff in integrating disabled youth into center activities. The JCC Association and the National Foundation of Jewish Culture helped create the Jewish Council for the Arts to promote Jewish art and culture. To reflect the growing needs of adults over fifty years old, a JCC task force began the development of new and modern adult programming.
        Additionally, a JCC North America Kallah program was begun to provide focused, high profile, and exciting adult Jewish programming. In the year 2000, the JCC Association Center for Jewish Education was started with the goal of providing on-going training and development for JCC professionals. This new educational association serves as a resource for Jewish educators and provides them with
        guidance in the development of Center education initiatives.</p>
      <p>The new century finds the JCC Association continuing to adapt, innovate, and refine its vision of the future. Like its predecessors, the goal of the JCC Association is to strengthen the bonds of the Jewish community. Thus, the theme of the 2000 Biennial was "Building Meaningful Jewish Community" and it found over 1000 lay leaders, board members, presidents and executives from JCCs across
        North America examining their past, debating plans for the future, and demonstrating the commitment of the JCC movement to American Jewry.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, there are no full-length contemporary studies of the Jewish Welfare Board or the Jewish Community Center movement, and the Board does not seem to have published any annual reports from 1970 to the mid-1990s.

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>This collection documents the National Jewish Welfare Board's (JWB) evolution from an organization founded in 1917 to provide support for soldiers in times of war, to an agency involved in all aspects of Jewish life both in the U.S. and abroad. The bulk of the material falls between 1921 and 1988. (In 1990, JWB recreated itself as the Jewish Community Centers Association of North
        America.)</p>
      <p>The collection consists of four main groups, each of which reflects a different function of JWB. Subgroup I, Governance, details the inner workings and operations of JWB, while Subgroup II, Jewish Community Centers, offers information on the various activities JCCs provided for their members, as well as a look at the services and assistance which JWB supplied to the centers itself.
        Subgroup III, Veterans' Affairs, describes JWB's efforts in support of soldiers, veterans, and their families, and Subgroup IV, Affiliated Organizations documents JWB's sponsorship of and partnership with other national Jewish organizations. (It should be noted that considerable overlap does exist between the subgroups.) Subgroups V and VI consist of audio-visual and oversized materials
        which were removed from the first four subgroups.</p>
      <p>Additional detailed description for each subgroup, series, and subseries is found below.</p>

              <p>This subseries documents JWB's activities and programs - including discussions of future plans - and provides a look at the inner workings of JWB's higher councils. The status and development of Jewish Community Centers (JCCs) in the USA and abroad is also documented here. The files located here relate to JWB's Biennial Conventions and meetings of the Executive Committee and Board
                of Directors; also included are proceedings of JWB's Fund Raising and Jewish Community Centers Divisions, Executive Council, and Finance Committee. Speeches by various JWB staff members, such as Cyrus Adler, the first president of JWB; Irving Lehman (president, 1921-1940); Frank Weil (president, 1940-1950), and Louis Kraft (Executive Director, 1939-1947) can also be found here. In
                addition, the subseries includes financial statements, constitutions, and annual reports of JWB. (The files from 1961 to 1969 consist solely of annual reports, but there are none for 1970 or 1971.) Material types include reports, correspondence, brochures, by-laws, clippings, newsletters, press releases, proposals, resolutions, surveys, transcripts, and drafts.</p>

              <p>This subseries consists mainly of the files of Frank Weil, who served as JWB president from 1940 to 1950. Some material relating to Irving Edison, JWB president from 1950 to 1954, can also be found here. As such, the documents provide information as to the activities and preoccupations of JWB's leaders during and immediately after World War II. Of particular note is the material
                on Jewish veteran affairs and files relating to JWB's efforts during World War II, including JWB's relationships with the Army and Navy, and with the USO. JWB's relationship with other Jewish and non-Jewish organizations is also documented here. (The subseries also includes a small amount of material related to the Frank L. Weil award, which was first given in 1951. The award
                recognizes distinguished work in JWB's three areas of focus: the JCC field, the Armed Services field, and the advancement of American Jewish culture.) The records contain correspondence, clippings, press releases, sketches, brochures, budget and financial materials, reports, speeches, by-laws and constitutions, histories, manuals, and photographs and recordiographs, which are

              <p>The Fund Raising Division functioned as the primary means to raise the funds needed to meet the cost of operating all of JWB divisions. The JWB received monies from various Jewish Welfare funds, Community Councils and, in New York City, from the Greater New York United Jewish Appeal fund. The JCCs and YMHAs around the country and Canada make up the rest of the monies needed to
                balance the budget. Other activities documented are the Korean War effort of JWB, community visits examining the fund raising campaigns of the Centers, and the meetings of the National Finance Council.</p>
              <p>Types of material include correspondence, pamphlets, newsletters, reports, financial statements, memoranda, articles, speeches, minutes, flyers, rules and regulations, bulletins, news clippings, press releases, policies, plans and procedures, field surveys, and photographs (located in <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subV">Audio/Visual Subgroup</ref>).</p>

              <p>At the 1956 Biennial a new group called JWB Associates came into being to draw from the larger JWB family. Although construed as a fund raising effort, the objective was to raise awareness in the community of all the functions of JWB, including services rendered to the Armed Forces overseas. JWB Facts says "JWB Associates was established in order to give individual community
                leaders in all part of the country an opportunity to express concretely their belief in the values of JWB's activities and to actively support its work beyond their regular contribution to their local Jewish federations and welfare funds."<emph render="super">1</emph></p>
              <p>The subseries highlights the fund raising and membership campaigns of JWB Associates as well as their role within the communities.</p>
              <p>The kinds of records found are brochures, membership lists, drafts, correspondence, worksheets, requisitions, computer printouts, and photographs (located in <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subV">Audio-Visual Material Subgroup</ref>).</p>

              <p>JWB adopted the Fair Share plan in 1960 in order to ensure that each JCC and YMHA gave to JWB a portion of monies in relation to its financial situation. A formula was established to determine the amount give by each Jewish community, ¼ of 1 percent of the annual average of the gross income raised by the local Jewish Federations over a three-year period plus 1.5 percent of the
                local JCC or YMHA's budget averaged over a three-year period. The Non-fair share communities included Jewish Welfare Fund, United Jewish Appeal, Armed Services Committee, Jewish Community Council, and Jewish Community Chest.</p>
              <p>The Support and Development materials reveal several aspects of JWB's relationship with the various JCCs and YMHAs. In particular are the conflicts between the agencies regarding fund raising, contributions, the fair share program, and the problem that local agencies had in raising money for the JWB within their communities. JWB had to combat the feeling of "What does the JWB do
                for me?" Also highlighted are the descriptions of services available to the local Jewish communities from the Centers and JWB.</p>
              <p>The Scholarship Material Files describe the fund established after Harold Dinerman's death for graduate students in social work and the people who donated monies to it. For more information on Harold Dinerman please see his biography in the appendix.

            <p>The Central Records Center was considered the "memory" of JWB because of the historic material filed within. By the mid-1960's JWB realized that their filing system was in chaos and requested the services of Colonel Seymour Pomrenze. The Colonel had previously been Archivist for the National Archives and an archivist for the US Military. Colonel Pomrenze helped the JWB develop a
              more efficient records management program in order to control the large amount of paperwork produced every year.</p>
            <p>The Central Records Center obtained copies of most of the documents released by each department within JWB so that the records could be used for reference purposes in the future and to establish institutional memory. Selected documents were eventually transferred to the Archives of JWB and kept permanently until they were given to the American Jewish Historical Society.</p>

            <p>This series consists primarily of materials relating to the planning and programming of JWB Biennial Conventions. The Biennial Convention consisted of forums and workshops on a variety of topics, covering all aspects of JCC operations. (The first Biennial was conducted in 1950; prior to that, JWB had held annual meetings.) These documents provide a look at JWB's and the JCCs'
              principal concerns over the years. Included here are the files of several JWB staff members involved in planning and carrying out Biennials. Individuals whose files are collected here include Harry B. Schatz, Harold Arian, Arthur Brodkin, Sherwood Epstein, and Mitchell Jaffe. (For additional information on these individuals, please see the biographical material in the appendix.) Of
              particular note are an address by President Truman, and letters from various senators and congressmen, including Senators John Fitzgerald Kennedy and Lyndon Baines Johnson. Also included is a small amount of material on other conferences and committees, such as the Committee on Admissions, which invited JCCs, Synagogues, and Hebrew centers to become members of JWB, and the Study
              Committee, which sought to increase the effectiveness of JWB and the Jewish community it serves. Included are reports, programs, correspondence, agendas, statistics, brochures, lists, questionnaires, minutes, clippings, photographs and audiotapes, which are located in the <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subV">Audio-Visual Materials Subgroup</ref>.</p>

              <p>This material documents the activities of JWB's camping services program, which provided consultation services to Jewish communal camps; assisted Federations and JCCs in providing proper camping facilities and effective programs; enhanced Jewish educational and cultural aspects of camping programs; conducted camping institutes; and cooperated with other national organizations in
                raising communal camping standards and in enriching Jewish camping.<emph render="super">4</emph> Day camping was first introduced to the center field by JWB in 1932 and though the camping program was originally focused on children, it grew to include older individuals as well, including the elderly and physically handicapped.<emph render="super">5</emph> JWB believed that "Jewish
                camps make a unique contribution to the welfare of the organized Jewish community. To a great extent camps, both resident and day, provide a totality of experiences which are not available anywhere else in the Jewish community... Camps provide an experience in democratic living and identification with the values of American society..."<emph render="super">6</emph></p>
              <p>This subseries provides a look at various aspects of the camping program, such as JWB's involvement with the National Conference on Jewish Camping (in Alfred Dobrof's files), and assistance provided by JWB to Jewish camps. Topics featured in Sherwood Epstein's files include design and structure of camps, and analysis of Jewish populations. The subseries also documents JWB's
                Shlichim and Uplan programs, whereby Israelis came to the U.S. to serve at JCC and Federation camps, while American high school students traveled to Israel. (Material on this can be found in Roslyn Kriegsfeld's files, as well as in the Leonard Rubin and Shlichim Program files.) In addition, the subseries includes analyses of JCC and YM-YWHA programs and operations, as they relate
                to camping services, field reports describing visits to camps, and scholarship grants, which document individuals selected to be camp counselors. (These files include photographs of the applicants.) Statements of purpose of various JCCs can also be found in Arthur Brodkin's files, as can studies and surveys related to camping. Materials consist of reports, studies, bylaws, surveys,
                brochures, budgets, lists, clippings, forms, pamphlets, proposals, procedures, speeches, agendas, constitutions, articles, manuals, resumes, minutes, correspondence, applications, questionnaires, photographs, and reel-to-reel tapes, which can be found in the <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subV">Audio-Visual Materials subgroup</ref>.</p>

              <p>JWB's Health and Physical Education Department sponsored "... training programs and institutes to enrich the scope of Center health, physical education, and recreation programs, [recruited] Jewish youth for careers in Center health, physical education, and recreation work, and [provided] consultation to Centers on the construction of adequate health and physical education
                facilities. The department also [assisted] in coordinating inter-city tournaments and leagues which provide opportunities for young people to broaden their Jewish association."<emph render="super">9</emph></p>
              <p>This material includes files maintained by Arthur Brodkin, who helped to fill health and physical education positions at JCCs. The Brodkin files contain application forms and requests for jobs, and thus provide information on individuals employed in health and physical education positions at JCCs and camps. The General files include documents maintained by Oliver Winkler and
                Michael Rand, both of whom served as Health and Physical Education consultants. Found here are files on a variety of sports and health-related topics, such as Olympic games, golf, volleyball, wrestling, swimming, tennis, track and field programs, and programming for pre-school children, the handicapped, and older adults. Material on health and sex education and on smoking programs
                can also be found here, as can material on various health-related issues, such as heart disease. The National Services Files include basketball and handball tournament material, as well as material on the People to People Basketball program in Mexico, and items documenting JWB's participation in the Conference for National Cooperation in Aquatics (NCA.) The Study Committee material
                reflects the committee's efforts to assess and evaluate JWB's Health and Physical Education programs and to develop recommendations for the improvement of services. (Committee reports are included here.) Finally, Oliver Winkler's files include materials documenting interactions with other organizations, as well as consultation studies on communities and evaluations of programs. The
                subseries consists of correspondence, application forms, minutes, annual reports, brochures, surveys, questionnaires, studies, rules and regulations, flyers, lists, proclamations, press releases, forms, schedules, speeches, clippings and photographs, which are located in the <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subV">Audio-Visual Materials Subgroup</ref>.</p>

              <p>In 1944 JWB became a sponsor and coordinator of the Jewish Book Council, which had originally been founded, in 1925, as Jewish Book Week and expanded through the following years.<emph render="super">10</emph> The Book Council's objectives were the stimulation of an abiding zeal for knowledge among young and old; the development of a Jewish cultural atmosphere in homes; the
                enrichment of educational programs of clubs, study circles and discussion groups; and the enlargement of book collections in institutional libraries, reading rooms, and private homes.<emph render="super">11</emph></p>
              <p>This subseries documents JWB's activities on behalf of the Book Council.<lb/> Included here is material on the publications Jewish Book Annual and Jewish Book World, as well as various other publications, such as scripts for The Eternal Light, a radio show presented by NBC for the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, and plays on Jewish themes. Jewish book awards were given for
                books in such subjects as fiction, history, children's literature, and the holocaust; these files document the process by which award recipients were selected, and also provide biographical information on the winners themselves. Materials include certificates, correspondence, forms, clippings, bibliographies, awards, books, lists, minutes, reviews, questionnaires, plays, scripts,

              <p>JWB became a primary sponsor of the Media Service in 1978, as did the Council of Jewish Federations and National United Jewish Appeal. (The Jewish Media Service was originally founded in 1973 by the Institute for Jewish Life, which operated under a mandate from the Council of Jewish Federations.) The Media Service evaluated and provided consultation and referral on media
                materials, distributed films and provided a central purchasing exchange for the purchase of equipment and films or videos. Further, the Media Service assisted communities in establishing media centers and conducted workshops on the use of media, as well as developing supplementary materials such as discussion guides. Finally, the Media Service consulted filmmakers and video
                producers, and published Medium, a Jewish media review.<emph render="super">12</emph></p>
              <p>The General files document the interaction of the Jewish Media Service with other Jewish organizations. Material on the Media Service's workshops and other programs can be found here, as can studies on the use of media in the promotion and support of Jewish culture. The Geographic files provide descriptions of Jewish film festivals, and other projects developed by organizations
                around the country, and also include files on activities in countries such as Canada, England, France, and South Africa. Also included are the files of Harry Kosansky, who, in his role as director of Program Development Services, oversaw the Jewish Media Service; this material documents the administration of the Media Service. Subject files contain descriptions of films in the
                Media Service's databank, on such topics as Arab-Israel conflict, American Jewish History, the Bible, parenting and Soviet Jewry. Material consists of correspondence, receipts, listings, scripts, programs, speeches, studies, brochures, forms, schedules, clippings, minutes, photographs, and phonograph records (which are located in the <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new"

              <p>This subseries documents the activities and functions of the Jewish Music Council, which was founded in 1944. The Music Council strove to collect and preserve traditional Jewish music and to connect that heritage to the growing musical life in America and in Israel.<emph render="super">13</emph> The files of the Commission on JWB's Role in Jewish Cultural Programming include
                background material on the commission, as well as its final results and recommendations. (The Commission recommended establishing an American Jewish Academy of the Cultural Arts, a Jewish Cultural Mass Media library and archive, and an American Jewish Cultural Center.) The General files contain indices and lists of Jewish music, Music Council budget, Biennial and committee
                materials, scripts for radio and television programs, and music and play scripts. In addition, the development of the <emph render="underline">Jewish Music Notes</emph> publication is documented here. The Geographic files document the Music Council's interactions with JCCs, synagogues, and temples, musical groups, orchestras, and other organizations. This material consists mainly
                of requests for information and materials from the Music Council, and illustrates the musical activities of Jewish organizations around the country. Finally, the subject files include music festival program material and materials for Israel's 25<emph render="super">th</emph> anniversary.

Other, more famous, people were asked by the JWB to join. Some of
                those asked were Gene Autry, Benjamin Spock, Arthur Miller, Adlai Stevenson, several US Senators, and Eleanor Roosevelt. With the exception of Benjamin Spock they all refused. A few of the artists who performed for the Lecture Bureau were Joey Adams, Terry Saunders with Norman Atkins, Herschel, Jack, and Sam Bernardi, Lillian Lux, Paddy Chayefsky, and Howard da Silva.</p>

              <p>JWB understood that one of its chief functions was to define the needs of the JCCs and YMHAs and help them meet those needs. Therefore:</p>
              <p>"JWB has instituted approaches to the testing and development of new Center programs. It is concerned with the improvement of practice through the utilization of research, demonstration projects and training programs with the objective of encouraging Centers to focus on the achievement of Jewish communal objectives as well as to deal with current communal concerns."<emph

              <p>The Youth Programming Department's material highlights how JWB assisted the various JCCs and YMHAs in developing valuable and instructive programs for the Jewish youth in their communities. The Jewish College Youth Files reflects how JWB reached out to Jewish College students and tried to determine what issues were paramount in their lives. The Jewish Youth Councils shows the
                manner in which JWB worked with young leaders to provide a significant opportunity for both the youth and the future of the Jewish community. The first White House Conference on Youth occurred in 1909 under President Roosevelt. The 1950 conference developed 5 goals:</p>
              <p>1. bring together in usable form pertinent knowledge related to the development of children and indicate areas in which further knowledge is needed; <lb/>2. examine the environment in which children are growing up, with a view to determining its influence upon them; <lb/>3. study the ways in which the home, the school, the church, the law, welfare agencies, and other social
                institutions, individually and cooperatively, are serving the needs of children; <lb/>4. formulate, through cooperative efforts of laymen and specialists, proposals for the improvement of parental, environmental and institutional influences on children; <lb/>5. suggest means whereby these proposals may be communicated to the people and put into action. <emph render="super"

              <p>Up until 1960 the Field Services Department carried out the community services function with field secretaries in place. In 1963 Field Services changed focus and became Regional Consultation. The field secretaries had previously traveled to various organizations all over the country and Canada to assist the executives and staff of these centers in any way that they could. Reports
                were written and feedback given. During the decade 1960 - 1970 the concentration shifted to particular communities throughout the country. Field Secretaries became Regional Consultants and their areas were now more concentrated to one district which they were to visit more frequently, as well as the 12 staff members who were spread out and assigned to Chicago, Newark, Boston,
                Philadelphia, San Francisco, Atlanta, and New York. After the JWB study of 1970 the department changed again to Department of Community Services and again roughly ten years later to Community Consultation Services. And the focus changed again to more national coverage. JWB states that<lb/> "it is the function of the JWB Community Consultant to be in regular communication with his
                communities through a variety of methods, including telephone, correspondence, other normal associations such as professional meetings and conferences and focused community visitations. Although there is no longer a pattern of regular visits, there is a pattern of regular communication in order to determine how we can be most helpful, including visitations when necessary. At a
                minimum, every JWB Consultant is in telephone communication with the executives of the centers no less than once a month."<emph render="super">16</emph></p>
              <p>Today the JWB is known as the JCC Association and according to their website:<lb/> "This year, JCC Association celebrated 80 years of assisting JCCs in responding to changing conditions and challenges. From its New York headquarters and its Western Region and Israel offices, JCC Association has provided leadership in the areas of staff recruitment and training, lay leadership
                development, field research, professional conferences, and workshops, consultation, publications, and specialized programming, enabling each of its constituent JCCS to better serve the needs of its members and community."<emph render="super">17</emph></p>
              <p>The subseries reflects how JWB offered the affiliated Y's, JCCs, and other organizations a link to JWB's headquarters and its many functions. Building plans and architects, program ideas, policy changes, and help finding and hiring new staff were all available for the asking. They also offered conferences for executives in small, intermediate, and large cities.</p>
              <p>Emanuel Berlatsky's files highlight his work within the various Jewish communities, the Colleges and Universities with social work programs, and the Field Services Committee. Jack Boeko's material shows his involvement with the Biennial Conventions, and Intermediate City Center Executive Seminars. Arthur Brodkin's files reflect his participation with the Biennial Conventions, the
                Jewish communities, and the Health and Physical Education Department. Sy Colen's files highlight his work with Belgian Youth, the Biennial Convention, and Jewish communities. Harold Dinerman's records show his involvement with area councils and the Jewish communities. The Englewood, NJ material reflects the study conducted in that Community. Philip Goodman's files consist of <emph

              <p>This material pertains to surveys of Jewish communities, self-studies of JCCs, and studies of other Jewish organizations. (The purpose of these studies was to evaluate the services of JCCs by analyzing Jewish population trends, determining how Jewish people spent leisure time, appraising existing JCC programs and studying Jewish participation in activities sponsored by other
                  organizations.<emph render="super">18</emph>) The files dating from 1921 to 1950 include many actual studies and surveys; after 1950 relatively few appear. The files from 1951 on consist mainly of correspondence, and some of these files contain only 1 or 2 memoranda and letters. Some states, such as Montana, Vermont, and Wyoming, are not represented at all, while for others a
                large amount of material is included. New York and Pennsylvania (particularly Philadelphia and Pittsburgh: the Irene Kaufmann Center and Settlement) are strongly represented. Some material on Canada (mainly Toronto) is also included, as is a small file (1 document) on South Africa. Materials of note include "A Study of Negro Housing in Atlanta Georgia, 1940 - 1956." (This was a
                sociology research paper written by a Dartmouth student.) Also of note are an YMHA Golden Anniversary Souvenir Book (1890-1940) for Louisville Kentucky and a 1953 JCC self-study manual, which provides guidance on the purpose and scope of surveys and studies. Finally, the early studies, such as a 1924 study of educational and recreational resources and needs of the Jewish Community
                on New York's Lower East side, provide an interesting look at Jewish communities in the early part of the 20<emph render="super">th</emph> century. The material includes surveys, studies, maps, field reports, correspondence, clippings, photographs (located in the <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subV">Audio-Visual Materials Subgroup</ref>), charts, maps, and blueprints

              <p>The subseries documents the work of the various field secretaries throughout the country and Canada. The period of 1921 to 1954 is especially rich in content and reflects the procedural changes made by the JWB during the course of the 33 years that the records cover. Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania have the largest concentration of material for all time spans. Also
                evident are the day-to-day problems faced by the organization and what, if anything, JWB was able to do to help them. After 1954, fewer visits were made by the field secretaries to the communities due to change in focus by JWB and the Department of Field Services. The drop-off in need by the centers may have been the catalyst. The Summary Field Work material documents each field
                visit performed by the field secretaries noting date of visit, location, and purpose. Of special interest is the Hecht House in Dorchester, MA; Baron de Hirsch Fund and Woodbine, NJ; New York Office of Civil Defense 1941-1953; Williamsburg YMHA NYC Brooklyn 1922-1954; Syracuse, NY 1922-1954; Philadelphia, PA 1922-1954 (Field Reports); Council of Jewish Federations and Welfare
                Funds; Federation of Jewish Philanthropies (Related Organizations); and First NJWB Annual Report 1919 (Anniversaries and Annual Reports).</p>
              <p>Types of documents found are field reports, summaries of field visits, newspaper clippings, pamphlets, annual reports, correspondence, and anniversary booklets.</p>

              <p>JWB divided the country into the following geographical areas (which were known as Sections, or Regions): Middle Atlantic, Midwest, New England, New Jersey, New York Metropolitan, New York State, Southern, and Western States. The Regions' mission was to promote close relationships between JCCs, Ys, and other organizations; to coordinate programs within organizations; to stimulate
                organization of new JCCs; and to aid member agencies in development and improvement of programs so that the agencies could contribute to the intellectual, religious, social and physical well being of Jews and Americans. Regions were visited by Community Consultants, who provided assistance and guidance to JCCs, Ys, Federations, Armed Forces Services Committees, and other
                organizations. Community Consultants served as the primary means for channeling JWB services to communities and provided both community planning and educational programming assistance.</p>
              <p>This subseries consists of correspondence, field reports, newsletters, maps, charts, diagrams, and blueprints (located in <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subVI">Oversized Materials subgroup</ref>) dealing with JCCs within the regional sections. (Some material on Canada is also included.) Of particular note are the Philadelphia camping materials in the Middle Atlantic
                Section, "Proceedings of an Institute on Models for Service to Jewish Families by JCCs," in the 1968 Santa Barbara California files, and the Bridgeport Connecticut survey material, which includes "Highlights in Center History, 1912-1957." </p>

              <p>This subseries documents activities within the Regions. Files on the Metropolitan and National Associations of Jewish Center Workers (NAJCW) and the National Council of YM and YWHAs of Canada are also included here. Materials of note include NAJCW's 1953 statement of principles and a Louis Kraft article on "NAJCW-35 Years." Other highlights include Keynotes, the Midwest Section's
                newsletter, and the Proceedings of the Institute for Teens, in NAJCW's 1966 file, and a file on the New York State Section's 50<emph render="super">th</emph> anniversary annual meeting. (This file includes statistics on the Centers and Ys in New York State.) Also of note are Convention materials, which provide summaries of each section's activities. (The New England section's
                  50<emph render="super">th</emph> annual convention program contains acknowledgements from New England Congresspeople.)

              <p>Federations: the earlier files are arranged alphabetically, while the 1939-1944 files are arranged first chronologically and then alphabetically; New York Metropolitan Area: Organization Files from 1958 on are chronological, then alphabetical. The majority of the New York Metropolitan Area Subject Files are arranged by date. (Many of these files actually cover a broader range of
                years than may at first be apparent. For example, the "1952" file ranges from 1951 to 1955, with the bulk of the material falling in 1952.) Approximately 6 feet of the Subject Files are arranged alphabetically. New York State Area: Herman Sainer's Administration on Aging files are arranged in three chronological subsets, while the Subject files are arranged in five chronological
                subsets: 1960-1962, 1964-1965, 1965-1966, 1966-1967, and 1967-1968. (As with the New York Metropolitan Area, a wider range of years is actually covered in each subset.)</p>

              <p>The files document activities within JWB's regional areas. There are no files for the Southern Section (which was formed in 1944), though the Atlanta Office files do cover activities at JCCs and Ys in the South. (The Federation files include a small amount of material on the early years of the Southern Section.) Atlanta, Charleston, Chattanooga, Dallas, Fort Worth, Memphis, New
                Orleans, and San Antonio are particularly strongly represented. Of particular note is the 1972 study of Jewish youth of Birmingham, Alabama. The material is arranged alphabetically by city, though some field reports are also collected in "Southern Section, JWB Field Reports." (Some other parts of the country are also included in the Atlanta Office files.)</p>
              <p>The Boston Office files pertain to the Institute for Jewish Life, which later became the Jewish Media Service. The documents reflect the Media Service's efforts regarding the effective use of media in Jewish education and in cultivating Jewish life in the United States. Included are evaluations of films made available through the Media Service, as well as information on
                institutions which rented the films. Some files on specific topics, such as Soviet Jewry, can also be found here. (For related material, see <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subIIserAsub5">Subgroup II: Jewish Community Centers/Series A: Program Services/Subseries 5: Jewish Media Service</ref>.) The Denver Office material provides information on activities in the Western
                Area. Of note are the files on USO Activities and teen conferences. Also included here are documents maintained by Herman Markowitz, who served as director of Western Services from 1971 to 1978; this material consists of files on JCCs and Ys in the U.S. and Canada. The Federation files chronicle the early years of Federations throughout the country. Items of note include issues of
                  <emph render="underline">New York Federation News</emph> and (in the files on the Metropolitan Association of Jewish Center Workers) a 1943 seminar on a postwar agenda.</p>
              <p>The Pennsylvania Federation of YMHAs held its first convention in 1910. In the 1920s, this Federation merged with the newly formed Middle Atlantic States Federation, and later became the Middle Atlantic Section of JWB.<emph render="super">19</emph> Of particular note in the Middle Atlantic files are the History files which include programs for the 1919, 1922, and 1925 section
                conventions, as well as constitutions and bylaws, and JCC objectives and statements of purpose. The Subject Files include annual reports, executive board minutes from 1923 to 1970 (there are no minutes from 1956 to 1965) and a statement of principles regarding Center-Federation relationships. Also included in the Subject Files are programming resources for the centenary of Jewish
                chaplaincy and materials on the merger of the Middle Atlantic Section and the 2<emph render="super">nd</emph> Army Services Committee. In addition, files Arthur Brodkin maintained in his role as community consultant can also be found here. These files document Bodkin's involvement in the Mid-Atlantic Council, as well as his role in Biennial preparation and Health &amp; Physical
                Education activities.</p>
              <p>The Midwest Section was founded in 1939 and was admitted into JWB the following year.<emph render="super">20</emph> The documents collected here consist of Community and Subject Files. The Subject Files include a study of Federation and Center Executives regarding their views of the American Jewish community, and also contain a variety of conference materials. Information on the
                Midwest section's 1963 and 1965 Biennials can be found here. Also included is material on the Centenary Committee; this includes a compilation of articles and speeches from various years, recounting events in JCC's development and history.</p>
              <p>The Scrapbook Files include bylaws and constitutions of the Midwest section. Some material on Canada is included in the Community files, and a photograph of the first five Midwest Area presidents is located in the <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subV">Audio-Visual Materials Subgroup</ref>.</p>
              <p>The New England Area files document activities in the New England region, including the actions of Alfred Dobrof and Leonard Katowitz, regional and community consultants. Included in the Administrative Subject Files are house policies, consisting of rules and guidelines for various JCCs, and work plans for the New England area. The History Files include dedication journals and
                studies of New England communities, while the Minutes Files include a program of the first annual convention of the Associated Ys of New England-the New England Section's predecessor-in 1911, as well as programs for other meetings up to 1952. Materials on the third to fifty-ninth New England annual conventions can be found in the Proceedings files, while the Subject files include
                New England constitutions and further material on conventions. (The 1954 convention file includes letters from the governors of Virginia, Maine, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania.) Also of note is a 1912 YMHA convention photograph, with signatures of the New England Region's board on the back; this can be found in the <ref

              <p>The New Jersey Federation of YMHAs was established in 1912 and joined JWB in 1921. About half of the New Jersey Area material consists of community files, documenting JCC and Y activities from 1966 to 1983. (Some files on New York, Connecticut, and Canada are included in the files of Jack Boeko, community consultant.) Of note in the Subject Files are the work plans of Mitchell
                Jaffe, consultant to the New Jersey Area and Assistant Director of Community Services, and Al Dobrof, New Jersey Consultant. Subject files also include a variety of material on Nursery School Institutes, Teen Activities, Health and Physical Education, and meetings of JCC and Y executives. Also of note is the JWB Study Committee material, which describes a proposed reorganization of
                JWB structure.</p>
              <p>The Metropolitan League of YMHAs and Kindred Associations, formed in 1913, was reorganized as the New York Metropolitan Section-Jewish Welfare Board in 1936. It served as the planning, activating, coordinating and servicing agency for Jewish Community Centers and kindred organizations in the five boroughs and neighboring parts of Westchester and Long Island.<emph render="super"
                  >21</emph> Almost half this subseries consists of files of the Metropolitan Section: included are the papers of Harold Arian, who was appointed Administrative Field Secretary in 1954 and served in that capacity until 1971. His files consist of journals (the Journal of Jewish Communal Service and Jewish Social Service Quarterly) and Subject Files. Of note in Arian's Subject Files
                are the materials on the Bronx Y Study and the Bronx Y Golden Age Club, and the 1966 Teen Workers conference, which includes material on the values of middle class Jewish teenagers.</p>
              <p>Articles of Incorporation, Constitutions, By-Laws and Financial Statements for the Metropolitan section can also be found here. (Some financial statements for JWB itself are also included.) Of particular note is the material on the Hunts Point project, which was initiated in the spring of 1934, as part of an experimental effort to reduce delinquency among Jewish youth. In
                addition, this section includes a 1946 survey of the New York City Jewish population's cultural and recreational needs, and files on JCCs and Ys in the various boroughs of the city. (These files are collected under Organizations and also under City Wide and National Agencies.) Over half of the New York Metropolitan material consists of Subject Files, the bulk of which fall between
                1941 and 1981. Items of note in the Subject Files include the History File, in the "1954" subject file and the Historical material in the Alphabetical Subject Files, which include constitutions and bylaws for the Metropolitan League of Ys and Kindred Associations, as well as the Metropolitan League of JCAs and other associations. Some reel-to-reel and audiotapes can be found in the
                  <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subV">Audio Visual Materials Subgroup</ref>.</p>
              <p>The New York State Section was first organized in 1915, as the New York State Federation of YMHAs, and joined JWB in 1921. The New York State material consists of Subject Files and the files of Herman Sainer, who became Administrative Regional Consultant in 1964. (Much of the material maintained by Sainer actually precedes this appointment.) Of note are the documents on the
                Administration on Aging, and the files on New York cities and towns. Some material from Arthur Brodkin's tenure as Field Secretary is included in the Subject Files. (Brodkin was appointed in 1961.) The Phoenix Office files consist of the records of George Korobkin, director of Western Services. This material is primarily administrative in nature.</p>
              <p>The Washington DC Office files document the work of that office, which focused on services to JWB, JCCs, and Armed Services. These services included public affairs, program and administrative services, representation of JWB to local and national meetings and federal departments and agencies and direction of the Government Division Campaign for United Jewish Appeal of Greater
                  Washington.<emph render="super">22</emph> Included here are June Rogul's files on JCCs. (Rogul served as director of the Washington Office.) Also included are community files documenting visits to Virginia JCCs conducted by Moe Hoffman in his capacity as Regional Consultant, and Subject Files, which include personal services files dealing with court martials in the 1960s.</p>
              <p>In 1936, eleven societies on the West Coast organized the Pacific Coast Federation of Jewish Community Centers, which was admitted into JWB two years later and became the Western States Section.<emph render="super">23</emph> Included here are the files of George Korobkin, who served as director of Western Services. (Additional Korobkin files can be found in the Phoenix Office
                material, and further information on the Western area can be found in the Denver Office files.) The Western Area material consists primarily of Community and Subject Files. The bulk of the Community Files concern Canada and the Western states, though some other states are also included. Of particular note is the material on the 1980s Kansas City Study, which assessed the JCC's
                adult education, fine arts, theater, jazz, poetry, early education, and humanities programs.</p>
              <p>The subseries includes correspondence, field reports, meeting minutes, brochures, reports, news clippings, surveys, journals, work plans, studies, personnel profiles, certificates, constitutions, by-laws, publications, photographs, audio-tapes, (located in the <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subV">Audio-Visual Materials subgroup</ref>), maps, charts, posters, and
                blueprints (located in the <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subV">Oversized Materials subgroup</ref>.)</p>

            <p>The Public Relations Department assisted JWB in maintaining its position as the leadership and central service agency of North American JCCs and YM-YWHAs. The Department helped to create and transmit JWB's messages to its constituents, thus fulfilling JWB's role as advocate for a united JCC movement. The Department served as JWB's liaison with the American Jewish and general press
              and also published the <emph render="underline">JWB Circle</emph>, which showcased the work of JWB, the Center movement, and individual JCCs. In addition, the Department provided JCCs, Centers, and Federations with a variety of publications, and evaluated the JCCs' own public relations material. The Department also consulted with local agencies, to assist them with their public
              relations efforts and promoted Jewish educational and cultural programming in JCCs.<emph render="super">24</emph></p>

              <p>The Department of Communications sought to promote a positive image of JWB as the headquarters for the Association of Jewish Community Centers and YM-YWHAs in North America and as the sponsoring agency for the Lecture Bureau, Jewish Music and Book Councils, Jewish Media Service, Armed Forces and Veterans' Services Committee, and Commission on Jewish Chaplaincy.<emph render="super"

              <p>The Department of Public Information promoted broader community understanding of the role of JCCs and also provided individual centers with technical public relations assistance and guidance.<emph render="super">26</emph> The duties of the director of Public Information Services included serving as the Executive Editor of <emph render="underline">JWB Circle</emph> and also
                researching and writing press releases on JWB/JCC activities, such as the Jewish Media Service and Lecture Bureau.<emph render="super">27</emph> The files collected here reflect JWB's efforts in this area and consist of correspondence, meeting materials, reports, printing plates, art work, certificates, speeches, surveys, pamphlets, fact sheets, art work, conference proceedings,
                biographies, contest entry forms, articles, press releases, news clippings, annual reports, yearbooks, newsletters, bulletins, bound volumes, (located in <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subVI">Subgroup VI: Oversized Materials</ref>), photographs, videotapes, film reels, audio-tapes, and slides (located in <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subV">Subgroup V:
                  Audio-Visual Materials</ref>).</p>
              <p>Some Biennial files are included here, as are some biographical files on individuals of note, such as Yitzhak Rabin, Sandy Koufax, Jack Dempsey, General Douglas MacArthur, Eleanor Roosevelt and Hank Greenberg. Biographical information on some JWB staff members is also included.) These files consist mainly of clippings and photographs, with the photographs located in <ref
                  actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subV">Subgroup V: Audio-Visual Materials</ref>. Materials of note in the General Files include some files on anti-Semitism and a 1944 speech by Massachusetts Representative James Curley and a signed letter from him. In addition, material on a radio program called "We the Guilty" can be found here, as can an index to the first two volumes of
                the <emph render="underline">JWB Circle</emph> and a 1949 pamphlet entitled "JWB Today" which describes the services JWB offered at that time. Other materials on note include some pencil drawings by Feingold, as well as printing plates for army and navy certificates. The Photographs: General and Historical Documents material includes Photostats of letters to JWB from Presidents
                Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy. (This material was found with the historical photographs located in <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subV">Subgroup V: Audio-Visual Materials</ref>)</p>
              <p>The files of Lionel Koppman, who became head of Public Information Services in 1970, include entry forms for JWB's Communications Awards competition, which honored public relations professionals working in a variety of communications media.<emph render="super">28</emph> (Related material can be found in the <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subV">Audio-Visual Material
                  series</ref>.) Entries were submitted by synagogues, JCCs, YM and YWHAs, camps, and VA chapels. The files of Arnulf Pins, in his capacity as chair of the National Jewish Youth Planning Commission can also be found here. Also of note are a wide variety of publications documenting activities at the national, regional, and local levels of JWB. Included here are annual and semi
                annual reports, position statements on various issues, meeting minutes, and newsletters, newspapers, and bulletins. (Bound volumes of the <emph render="underline">JWB Circle</emph>, dating from 1949 to 1965, can be found in the <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subVI">Oversized Materials Subgroup</ref>.)</p>
              <p>Finally, about a third of this material consists of the files of Bernard Postal, who became director of Public Information in 1946 and remained in that position until 1970. The bulk of the Postal material consists of General Files and Press Releases; some material on military heroes and Jewish families with more than one child serving in World War II is also included, as are some
                files on the Committee to Reappraise Public Understanding of JWB. Postal's General Files cover an extremely wide range of topics, from fascism and anti-Semitism in such countries as England, Germany, Czechoslovakia and Canada to the Boy Scouts. Files on individuals such as novelist Pearl Buck, Supreme Court Justice Black, actress Claire Bloom, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt
                are also included here, as are files on the Emergency Committee to save the Jews of Europe and a National Conference of Christians and Jews. A copy of the World War I High Holy Days Prayer book can also be found in Postal's General Files.</p>

                workers.<emph render="super">29</emph></p>

              <p>The personnel services files include materials on all aspects of employment, including recruitment, retention, counseling, placement, and training. Almost half this subseries consists of personnel files on applicants, employees, and scholarship and Shlichim candidates; these files, which contain social security numbers, medical records, and other personal information, including
                transcripts, are restricted.</p>
              <p>Shlichim applicants are documented in the Bessie Pine's files, while information on staff grievances and interactions with the Union can be found in the Edward Kagen material. The restricted Personnel Data and Profile files provide data about JWB's employees, with the Professional Personnel Records containing information on several high level employees such as Louis Kraft, Aryeh
                Lev, Sanford Solender, and Chester Jacob Teller. (Located here is a file on Nathan Witkin including information on the Medal of Freedom he received in 1947.) Sherwood Epstein's files reflect his role as New England Community and Personnel Consultant and Staff Coordinator of JWB's Northeast Area Council. (Of particular note are his files on the Manpower Utilization Study, which
                sought to improve the use and productivity of JCC employees with baccalaureate degrees.<emph render="super">30</emph>) Also included are the files of Solomon Greenfield, who served as Director of Personnel from 1974 to 1977 and subsequently as assistant executive director of JWB (1977-1980) and associate executive director (1980-2000.) (The bulk of Greenfield's files either predate
                or postdate his tenure as Director of Personnel.) Finally, the subseries provides a look at the variety of training programs implemented by JWB. Specifically, information on the New Workers Orientation Institute can be found in the Staff Training: Irving Brickman files and material on the Executive Development Training Program can be found in the [Executive] Training files. The
                series consists of correspondence, clippings, conference materials, transcripts, personnel profiles, performance evaluations, publications, medical records, chart, architectural drawings, and photographs (primarily located in the <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subV">Audio-Visual Materials Subgroup</ref>, though application photographs remain with the applications.)</p>

              <p>In 1982 an ad hoc committee of JWB's Board of Directors called for a high-level commission to increase Jewish educational effectiveness. The Commission visited communities and JCCs and heard reports and presentations, before compiling a report in 1984.<emph render="super">31</emph> This material documents the Commission's review of JCCs and its deliberations and recommendations;
                it includes conference files and files on visits to JCCs and Ys, at which the development of education programs was tracked. Also included is a study conducted by Dr. Bernard Reisman in 1988, to determine the progress made since the reports of the Commission and of the later Committee on Implementation. The Commission's 1984 report can be found here, as can questionnaires completed
                by JCC camp staff. Additional materials consist correspondence, clippings, reports, and meeting minutes.</p>

              <p>The bulk of this material documents the activities of Harold Arian, in his role of coordinator of Jewish Educational and Cultural Programs. In this capacity, Arian directed JWB's Israel projects and activities, and oversaw the work of the Jewish Book Council, National Jewish Music Council, and Lecture Bureau. He also served as liaison to national Jewish organizations and delegate
                to the United Nations.<emph render="super">32</emph> (Some documents pertaining to Arian's earlier work as a field secretary for the New York Metropolitan Area are also included. Further material on this is located in the Field Services series.) Included here are files on cultural arts conferences (with particular emphasis on the 1976 Bicentennial), educational and cultural
                activities throughout the country, and the Israel Program and Information Desk (IPID) Project. (This program was aimed at "encouraging and facilitating increased American study, volunteerism, travel, business ventures, employment and settlement in Israel.<emph render="super">33</emph>" The project's goal was to establish Israel Desks at JCCs throughout the United States and
                Canada.) A variety of material on Israeli programs, seminars, and camps can be found here. Of particular note is a photograph of JCC secretaries in Atlantic City in 1924, which can be found in the <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subV">Audio-Visual Materials Subgroup</ref>. Also included here is some historical material on the National Association of Jewish Center
                Workers, including some material written by Louis Kraft, and a "Celebration of Israel's 25<emph render="super">th</emph> Anniversary, written for Frank Sinatra, Walter Matthau, and Edward G. Robinson.</p>
              <p>This subseries also contains files maintained by Rabbi Philip Goodman, who served as director of Jewish education from 1944 to 1968. (The Jewish Education department provided JCC's with advice on Jewish content and assistance in dealing with Jewish education problems. The department maintained a library of program aids and Jewish holiday bulletins, containing stories, games,
                quizzes, and plays, which were available for use by JCCs.<emph render="super">34</emph>) A variety of material related to Israel-such as material on Independence Day and Aliyah-is included here. Much of the material was created by other (non JWB) organizations, such as the American Zionist Youth Foundation, the Jewish Agency, and the United Jewish Appeal. Of particular note are the
                pamphlets and dramatizations. Additional materials found here include discussion/study guides, articles, educational kits, meeting minutes, reports, correspondence, clippings and photographs and film strips (located in the <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subV">Audio-Visual Materials Subgroup</ref>.)</p>

              <p>In 1943 the Jewish Center Division was created in order to bring together the function of the Centers under one heading. All aspects of Center life were organized thought the JCD. In the 1960's the name changed from Jewish Center Division to Jewish Community Center Division, and again to Jewish Community Center Services.</p>
              <p>The Jewish Center Activities material reflects the various activities that were offered by the Centers. Of special interest are a copy of <emph render="italic">Theodore Herzl A Memorial</emph>, 1929 and newspaper clippings from Europe during the 1930's.</p>
              <p>Within the Jewish Center Division Committee materials are <emph render="italic">Postwar Jewish Center Building Problems</emph>, 1948, quarterly reports of all departments, 1946 and <emph render="italic">Program Reconversion: Report to JCCs transferring wartime gains to peaceful programs</emph>, undated.</p>
              <p>Of note in the research materials are the questionnaires that were taken in 1948 by youth 13 - 18 years of age. Questions asked were: Why did you come to the center tonight? Where would you and your friends go if there were no center here? Why do you usually come to the center? The questionnaires were left in the original groupings.</p>
              <p>There are 5 types of reports found in the Report files. The first type, and most numerous, are annual reports of the various JCCs, synagogues, and YMHAs affiliated with the JWB. The annual reports reflect the number of members by gender, membership rates, changes in membership, types of groups and activities offered, attendance, income and expenses, size of building, and
                facilities available. These reports are arranged by the geographic regions used by the JWB: New England, Middle Atlantic, Mid-West, New York State, Metropolitan New York, New Jersey, Southern, and Western. Pennsylvania is divided into Middle Atlantic and Mid-West. At the end of the most recent annual reports are several special studies that pertain to the reports themselves.</p>
              <p>The second type of report is the monthly reports of the Jewish Center Activities Department. These monthly reports record the activities offered by the various affiliated centers and synagogues around the country. These reports span 1927-1938.</p>
              <p>The third type of report consists of reports that were subsequently published such as the annual reports of 1942 and 1956, Twenty Years of Community Service, and the Minneapolis Communal Survey.</p>
              <p>The fourth type of report is the studies and surveys conducted by the JWB of Jewish communities throughout the US.</p>
              <p>The fifth type of report is the proceedings, minutes, and reports from institutes held throughout the country from 1947-1960.</p>
              <p>These files include emergency membership reports, telegrams, charts, correspondence memoranda, newspaper clippings, budgets, minutes, evaluations, index cards, speeches, articles, financial statements, maps (located in <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subVI">Subgroup VI: Oversized Materials</ref>), photographs (located in <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new"

            </p>
            <p>In 1940, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt requested that JWB, along with the YMCA, YWCA, National Travelers Aid Association, Salvation Army, and the National Catholic Community Service, handle the recreational needs of members of the Armed Forces. As a result, the United Services Organizations (USO) was founded in 1941,<emph render="super">36</emph> with JWB participating
              actively in all aspects of the USO's operations. In addition to its USO activities, the Armed Forces &amp; Veterans' Services (AFVS) division (originally organized in 1917 as the Army and Navy Committee and renamed the Army and Navy Services Division in 1924 before being renamed again in 1947) consisted of two main programs: Field Operations, responsible for determining
              assignments and managing personnel matters for field staff, and the Overseas Program<emph render="super">37</emph>, responsible for meeting the religious and related welfare needs of servicemen abroad. This series provides a look at JWB's various activities in support of soldiers and veterans from World War II onward.</p>
            <p>Much of the material collected here-Geographic Files, Overseas, Regions, USO Geographic Files, and USO Narrative Reports-has to do with activities undertaken by JWB and the USO both overseas and at stateside military bases. (In addition to sponsoring and maintaining its own field offices, which covered military installations and neighboring communities, JWB staff also maintained and
              directed field offices and clubs on behalf of the USO.<emph render="super">38</emph>) Material on Armed Services Committees throughout the country can be found in the Geographic files, while the Regions files consist largely of administrative and financial matters. The USO Geographic and Narrative reports files provide information about events at USO clubs.</p>
            <p>Also included are the files of Joseph Greenhut, director of Field Operations from 1955 to 1956. Items of note found here include USO-JWB work plans, which give insights into the interactions of the two organizations, and a manual entitled "Publicizing JWB's Armed Services Program: A Manual for USO-JWB Workers and Jewish Chaplains." Other interesting materials can be found in the
              Committees files, which include meeting minutes for the AFVS Executive Committee, the National Advisory Council on Service to Military and Veterans, and the Cuban Crisis Committee. Additional meeting materials are located in the USO Subject files, which also contain files on USO Presidents Chester Barnard, Lindsey Kimball, Harper Sidley and Executive Director Edwin Bond. (A USO
              insignia is included in the Army and Navy Subject File.) In addition, the series contains War Claims files, pertaining to JWB's successful claims against the governments of Italy, the Philippines, Austria, Germany, Czechoslovakia and Japan, for compensation for supplies lost, damaged, and destroyed during World War II. (This material includes lists of Jewish Chaplains who served in
              the European Theatre of Operations during World War II, as well as those in the Pacific Combat Zone and in China, Burma, and India.) Finally, a small amount of material on the Bureau of War Records can be found in the Jewish War Veterans files, and a variety of interesting information can be found in the World War II Subject Files, which consist primarily of news clippings. Topics
              include refugees, Passover, and the activities of Chaplains. (Several articles focus on the chaplains' efforts to liberate and assist displaced persons and concentration camp survivors.) Clippings pertaining to Joe Rosenthal, who took a famous photograph of the U.S. flag being raised on Iwo Jima, are included here. Also of note are some building plans for a community center in
              Balboa, which can be found in the <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subVI">Oversized Materials Subgroup</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Commission on Jewish Chaplaincy (CJC), founded in 1917 as the Chaplain's Committee of the Jewish Welfare Board, was composed of leaders of the Rabbinical Assembly of America, the Rabbinical Council of America, and the Central Conference of American Rabbis.<emph render="super">39</emph> By 1922 the organization had become known as the Sub-Committee on Chaplains and Religious
              Observance; the name subsequently changed to the Committee on Religious Activities (1940), the Committee on Army and Navy Religious Activities (1942), and the Division of Religious Activities (1947). The Division was renamed the Commission on Jewish Chaplaincy in 1952 and kept this name until 1987, when it became known as the [JWB] Jewish Chaplains' Council. Under any name, the
              organization's purpose was to recruit and train chaplains and lay leaders to provide services to Jewish military personnel and their families. This subseries documents CJC's activities, with particular focus on World War II and beyond.</p>
            <p>Over half the material found here comprises files on individual chaplains. These files consist mainly of application forms and photographs, as well as narrative reports and correspondence with CJC headquarters, and correspondence with soldiers and their families. This material provides an interesting look at the various activities undertaken by the chaplains during the Second World
              War, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, as well as during times of peace. (Also included is a small amount of information on Jacob Frankel, a Jewish chaplain in the Civil War, and the files on Nathan Blechman and Elkan Voorsanger include documents pertaining to their activities during World War I.) Materials of note include the documents concerning David Goldberg, the first Jewish
              chaplain in the Navy;<emph render="super">40</emph> this file includes information on the navy chaplaincy insignia.</p>
            <p>Also of interest is the file on Alexander Goode, posthumous recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross. Goode was one of the Four Chaplains who went down with the SS Dorchester on February 3, 1943. Further material on the Four Chaplains can be found in the General Files and in the Subject Files (in the Rabbis/Chaplains file.) The series contains sizable amounts of material on
              Aryeh Lev who served as director of CJC from 1945 to 1976 and Joseph Messing, director from 1982 to 1983. Large files also exist on several individuals, including: Benjamin Tintner (this material ranges from the 1920s to the 1950s and covers activities at West Point); Albert Lewin, whose file includes a chaplain's insignia pin; Oscar Lifshutz, the first Jewish Chaplain on combat duty
              in Korea and recipient of the Bronze Star and several other honors<emph render="super">41</emph>; Judah Nadich (the first advisor to General Eisenhower on Jewish affairs in the European theater of operations<emph render="super">42</emph>); and Henry Tavel, the first Jewish chaplain to receive the rank of Colonel in the U.S. Army.<emph render="super">43</emph> Also included is a file
              on Roland Gittelsohn, the first Jewish Chaplain appointed by the Marine Corps, who gave a famous memorial address at Iwo Jima. Material on chaplains' work with displaced people during and after WWII can be found in the files for Mayer Abramowitz, Max Braude, David Max Eichhorn, Herbert S. Eskin, Morris Frank, Herbert Friedman, Meyer J. Goldman, Joseph Miller, Harold Saperstein and
              Max Wall, among others. (Further material on this can be found in <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subIIIserA">Subgroup III: Veterans' Affairs/Series A: Armed Forces and Veterans' Services/World War II Subject Files</ref>.) The series also includes a short run of incomplete chaplaincy applications.</p>
            <p>The lay leaders files include applications, dating between 1969 and 1985, of individuals who supplemented the work of the chaplains and provided religious coverage in areas without chaplains.<emph render="super">44</emph> As with the Chaplains' files, these include small photographs which were submitted with the applications.</p>
            <p>The staff and past members files provide information on staff members Joel Balsam (director of CJC, 1977-1978), David Max Eichhorn (director of CJC Field Operations, 1945-1968), Gilbert Kollin (director of CJC, 1979-1981) and A. Elihu Michelson (associate director of CJC, 1952-1975), while the Resource files include orientation materials for new personnel. Also of note are the
              prayer books, ranging from 1917 to 1956, the Journal of a U.S. Solder (in General Files) and, in Organizations: Military Organizations, the Veterans Administration material regarding a plan to eliminate the chaplains service, and the Military Installations files, which document activities at military bases both in the U.S. and overseas. The Organizations: Jewish Organizations Files
              provide background on the CJC's relationship with national Jewish agencies, while the Organizations: Military Organizations Files include information on CJC's interactions with the Army, Navy, and Air Force and include the blueprints for a Navy pennant and a 7-light candelabrum. (These are located in the <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subVI">Oversized Materials
                subgroup</ref>.)</p>
            <p>Materials of note in the Subject files include (in Chaplaincy Statistics), lists of WWI chaplains and orthodox chaplains who served on extended active duty between 1861 and 1962, the booklet Brothers in Arms (in the Rabbis/Chaplains file), and the JWB-published book <emph render="italic">Responsa in Wartime</emph> (in the Committee Responsa in Wartime file.) Also included is
              material on the history of the Chaplaincy (in the History Project and Research Project files.) The War Records file includes material on the participation of Jews in the U.S. armed forces.</p>
            <p>The series also includes a variety of photographs, located in the Audio-Visual Materials Subgroup. These include a 1963 photograph of Chaplain Seymour Brickman with President John F. Kennedy and General Westmoreland and, also from 1963, a photograph of Former President Dwight D. Eisenhower with Chaplain Judah Nadich. A photograph of President Eisenhower with Chaplain Joshua Goldberg
              and other chaplains can also be found here.</p>

            <p>The Women's Organizations' Services (WOS) Division was organized in 1942 (as the Women's Organizations' Division) to help maintain the morale of men and women in the Armed Forces, and of patients in Veterans' Administration hospitals. WOS was composed of several national Jewish organizations including Hadassah, the National Bureau of Federated Jewish Women's Organizations, the
              National Council of Jewish Women, the National Federation of Temple Sisterhoods, the National Women's League of the United Synagogue of America, the United Order True Sisters, and B'nai B'rith. WOS ran four main programs: Serve-a-Camp, which, through local committees, sent supplies to JWB-USO workers stationed at isolated camps and bases; Serve-a-Chaplain, which shipped supplies to
              chaplains overseas; Serve-an-Overseas Hospitality Center, and Serve-a-Hospital, which provided gifts to patients in veterans hospitals and Army and Navy general hospitals.<emph render="super">45</emph> All of these programs offered large quantities of Hanukah, Purim, and Passover items to soldiers and patients in veterans' hospitals.</p>
            <p>This series documents the activities of the various organizations affiliated with WOS; these organizations raised money and collected goods-ranging from kosher food for Passover, to gifts for Chanukah and books for chaplains' libraries-for the chaplains, lay leaders, and Veterans' Administration Voluntary Service volunteers. Also included here are the files of Diana Bernstein Coran,
              who served as director of WOS beginning in 1957. These files consist of program materials for Chanukah, Passover, Purim, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, and the Shabbat, and contain recipes, plays, meeting ideas, crafts, games, fund raising ideas, bibliographies and temple services in Hebrew and English. Meeting minutes and news clippings can also be found here, while some
              photographs are located in the Audio-Visual Materials Subgroup. Of particular note are a medal from walk-a-thon, mezuzah parchments, a vinyl record titled "Shabbat Sholom" (to be found in the <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subV">Audio/Visual Materials subgroup</ref>) and a campfire girls poster. Also of note are "A Book of Jewish Thoughts" and "The Oppenheim
              Pictures."</p>

            <p>The series National Affiliated Organizations reflects the relationship between JWB and the various organizations that allied themselves under the umbrella of JWB. With the exception of NAJCW, which came into existence because of the JWB, the other organizations were founded as individual groups to stand on their own merit. After WWI and WWII, however, many organizations had
              difficulty in obtaining the funds needed for day-to-day operations. These organizations chose to become affiliated with the JWB in order to receive some of the needed funds from JWB itself. JWB actively sought some of these organizations others contacted JWB themselves. "A Century of the Jewish Community Center Movement" states that:</p>
            <p>"The National Association of Jewish Center Workers, founded in 1918... conducts annual conferences, publishes papers, stimulates research in various aspects of Center work and issues a quarterly magazine devoted to the professional interests of its membership."<emph render="super">46</emph></p>
            <p>The records document the correspondence between JWB and the assorted organizations concerning the representation and membership issues involved with joining the larger organization. B'nai B'rith's material is a good example as to how the organizations functioned after joining JWB and the concerns that arose around the affiliation. Also highlighted is the relationship between JWB and
              its professional staff who belonged to NAJCW.</p>
            <p>Of special interest are the materials relating to Jewish History Week, which was sponsored by the American Jewish Historical Society to promote the rich history of the Jews in America.</p>
            <p>Types of documents include reports, lists, correspondence, budgets, memoranda, minutes, annual meeting programs, speeches, by-laws, photographs (located in <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subV">Audio/Visual Subgroup</ref>), newspaper clippings, donation information, building plans (some are located in <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subVI">Oversized Materials

              Community Centers. As indicated by their website, the objectives of the WCJCC are:</p>
            <p>1. To encourage the development of Jewish Community Centers and enable them to enhance Jewish continuity, strengthen Jewish identification, further Jewish and Israel cultures and deepen Jewish knowledge and values in Jewish communities throughout the world. <lb/>2. To express and enrich the sense of unity between the Jewish people around the world and the people and State of Israel
              and to help build understanding and relationships among the Jewish people in the various lands. <lb/>3. To serve as a symbol of the common purposes shared by all Jewish Community Centers. <lb/>4. To serve as a council of national and continental federations of Jewish Community Centers and other interested bodies, committed to the work of Jewish Community Centers throughout the world.
              <lb/>5. To provide a forum and vehicle for exchange of information and to expedite communication among Jewish Community Centers in various lands. <lb/>6. To seek ways to aid directly the development and enrichment of Jewish Community Centers in Jewish communities not represented by a national or continental federation.<emph render="super">47</emph></p>
            <p>The series consists of Morton Mandel and Herbert Millman's correspondence and subject files as Director and Executive Director of WCJCC. Of particular interest are the documents relating to WCJCC's conferences.</p>
            <p>Types of documents include correspondence, memoranda, by-laws, and reports.</p>

            <p>The World Federation of YM &amp; YWHA and JCCs was founded on January 1, 1947 by the JWB, National Council of YM &amp; YWHA's of Canada, National YMHA's of Australia, and the Association for Jewish Youth of England. The Articles of Federation from 1961 state the objectives as:</p>
            <p>1. Interchange of ideas and experiences and the provision of opportunities for effective cooperation between the national organizations. <lb/>2. The utilization of the machinery of the organization to foster the Jewish Center Movement in all countries where feasible and desirable. <lb/>3. Undertaking such other functions as may, from time to time, appear to the Federation likely to
              benefit its affiliated national member bodies.<emph render="super">48</emph></p>
            <p>The World Fed was JWB's link to the JCCs and YMHAs around the world. The series contains the correspondence and reports exchanged by the affiliated organizations and JWB. It was also a critical player in the building and funding of the Jerusalem Y's new campus in 1967.</p>
            <p>The Geographic Files document JWB's relationship with YMHAs, JCCS, and Jewish Youth Groups around the world and is similar to the Countries Overseas and Foreign Countries files. The documents of the Jerusalem Y follow its opening in 1950 to the dedication of the new building in 1967. Included are the blueprints of the new building, records of payments from fund raising efforts, and
              photographs of the plaques placed throughout the facility to recognize those who gave substantial amounts of money. The Meetings and Biennial material highlights the World Fed's part in JWB's Biennial Conventions and their own executive committee meetings. Asher Tarmon's files consist of reports and correspondence that mostly predate his directorship of World Fed and documents his
              role in Jewish educational programming and the building of the Jerusalem Y's new facility.</p>
            <p>Of special interest are the materials relating to Louis Kraft, the dedication given by President Shazar at the opening of the new Jerusalem Y, addresses given by Ambassador Avraham Harman and his wife Zena in 1962 and 1963 on why the new Jerusalem Y building was needed, proposals by the government of Israel for the utilization of the funds accumulated under the informational media
              guaranty program, Association for Jewish Youth of England, and a 68 page report by Morris Levin on the Jerusalem Y found in the Countries Overseas files.</p>
            <p>Types of material include correspondence, bulletins, reports, "Y's of the World", contribution information, biographical information, interview transcripts, contracts, maps (located in <ref actuate="onrequest" show="new" target="subVI">Oversized Materials Subgroup</ref>), a plaque, resumes, program materials, newspaper clippings, press releases, meeting minutes and agendas,

          <p>This subgroup consists of photographs and other audio-visual materials removed from the earlier subgroups. In most cases, photographs were replaced with either photocopied images or separation sheets. However, in the processing of the Commission on Jewish Chaplaincy (CJC) files, in the Veterans' Affairs Subgroup a slightly different procedure was followed. (See note.) All photographs
            are notated to indicate their original locations; thus the researcher may examine any documents related to the image.</p>
          <p>A wide variety of activities are captured here, ranging from conferences to religious services, from photographs of soldiers to photographs of swim meets. Photographs of the exteriors of JCCs, YM-YWHAs, and military bases from throughout the world can be found here, as can photographs of activities both in the United States and abroad. The wide range of activities which JCCs provided
            for members of all ages is well represented, as is JWB's involvement with prominent members of the public. Individuals pictured here include political figures such as Richard Nixon, Dwight David Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Harry Truman, Eleanor Roosevelt and athletes such as the Harlem Globetrotters and Sid Gordon of the New York Giants. JWB's actions during the first and second world
            wars are strongly represented here by photographs of chaplains engaged in a wide range of activities, and by photographs of soldiers and veterans. Of particular note are some images of chaplains and soldiers with Concentration Camp survivors.</p>
          <p>In addition to photographs, a variety of other audio-visual formats can be found here. These include VHS and BETA videotapes submitted by JCCs as contestants for JWB's Communications Awards, slides, negatives, filmstrips, and film reels.</p>
          <p>Note on processing of CJC photographs: Photographs in the chaplains' and lay leaders' files were copied only when they were directly linked to documentation. However, in all cases when photographs were removed, a form was placed in the original folder, indicating that photographs have been removed and can be found at the end of the collection.</p>
